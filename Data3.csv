ignored it. I know I did - many times! However,
please take a few moments to read this letter.
I was amazed when the profit potential of this
business finally sunk in... and it works!With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,
success in this business is now fast, easy and
well within the capabilities of ordinary people
who know little about internet marketing. And the
earnings potential is truly staggering!I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -
follow what it says to the letter - and you will not
worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is
President, or whether you keep your current job or not.
Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded
to one of these before either. One day though,
something just said: ""You throw away $25.00 going to
a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck.""
Believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings""
come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be
doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it.
It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying
and selling something of value.AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5
months from your home.THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!
==================================================
BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following.
This is the letter you have been hearing about on the
news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on
the internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this
program described below, to see if it really can make
people money. The show also investigated whether or
not the program was legal.Their findings proved once and for all that there are
""absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in
the program and if people can 'follow the simple
instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks
with only $25 out of pocket cost"".DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING
BETTER THAN EVER.This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this
profitable opportunity. I was approached many times
before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad
I finally joined just to see what one could expect
in return for the minimal effort and money required.
To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00
in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.""Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.
==================================================
Another said: ""This program has been around for a
long time but I never believed in it. But one day
when I received this again in the mail I decided
to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the
money started to come in. First month I only made
$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months
by re-entering the program, I have made over
$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to
success in this program is to follow the simple
steps and NOT change anything.""More testimonials later but first, =========== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ====
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$If you would like to make at least $500,000 every
4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the
following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND 
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!INSTRUCTIONS:=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the
person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.
MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP
LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===
===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save
them on your computer and resell them.
YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each
of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.
Save them on your computer so they will be accessible
for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will
order them from you. Also make a floppy of these
reports and keep it on your desk in case something
happens to your computer.IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who
are listed next to each report, or their sequence on
the list, in any way other than what is instructed
below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out
on the majority of your profits. Once you
understand the way this works, you will also
see how it will not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you
alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried
to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five
thinking they could get all the money. But it does
not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to
be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not
try to change anything other than what is instructed.
Because if you do, it will not work for you.
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a
product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it
as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short
period of time.1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this
advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the
person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through
the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 26.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address
ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.==================================================
**** Take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names, and save it on your computer.
DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose
any data. To assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will
provide you with invaluable marketing information
which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,
where to find thousands of free classified ads and
much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this
venture going:METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY
==================================================Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see
how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved
send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume
that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)
response (the response could be much better but let's
just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send
out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only
5,000 each.Continuing with this example, you send out only
5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of
50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%
responded with orders. That's 100 people who
responded and ordered Report # 2.Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for
a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a
total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%
response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each
for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report # 5.THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00
(half a million dollars).Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50
+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000
+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND
FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO
MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!
==================================================REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think
for a moment what would happen if everyone or half
or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000
e-mails each or more?There are over 150 million people on the internet
worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming
online every day. Believe me, many people will do
just that, and more!METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
==================================================Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and
there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest
you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you
go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it.
Always provide same day service on all orders.This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt
because they cannot advertise until they receive
the report.===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is
illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time.
Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or
approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one
can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal
it before it gets to you.ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for
each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the
cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least
2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of
paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report
you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your
name and postal address.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW :

Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails

after that you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or
sending e-mails until you do.** Once you have received 100 or more orders for
Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is
already working for you, and the cash will continue
to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time
your name is moved down on the list, you are placed
in front of a different report.You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO

instructed above. One of the people you send this
to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your
name will be on every one of them. Remember though, the more you send out the more
potential customers you will reach. So my friend,
I have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============
""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she
had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!
I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois
================================================
""Not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial
investment was so little that there was just no way
that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back. I was surprised when I found my
medium size post office box crammed with orders.
I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big.""Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada
=================================================
""I had received this program before. I deleted it,
but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.
Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed
again by someone else......... 11 months passed then
it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!
I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
money came within 22 weeks.""Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.
=================================================
""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively
easy money with little cost to you. I followed the
simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the
money started to come in. My first month I made $20,
in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the
third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.
Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.""Fred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand

""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in
Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
received this program I grumbled to Jody about
receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the population
and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work.
Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and
few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made
merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had
received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she
had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!
I was shocked. I have joined Jody in her 'hobby'.""Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois
================================================
""Not being the gambling type, it took me several
weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.
But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial
investment was so little that there was just no way
that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get
my money back. I was surprised when I found my
medium size post office box crammed with orders.
I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is that it does not
matter where people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return and so big.""Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada
=================================================
""I had received this program before. I deleted it,
but later I wondered if I should have given it a try.
Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get
another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed
again by someone else......... 11 months passed then
it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!
I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
money came within 22 weeks.""Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.
=================================================
""It really is a great opportunity to make relatively
easy money with little cost to you. I followed the
simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the
money started to come in. My first month I made $20,
in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the
third month my total cash count was $362,840.00.
Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet.""Fred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand

426,"Hi,I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  
I'm ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over 
$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret,
it's the dirty little secret of the Internet ...You've probably heard stories about people making
whopping huge money online, but you thought they 
were the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or
boy-geniuses.Well, grasshopper, think again ...It's people like you and me that are making the real
money.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!Ever since the ""dot com bubble"" burst in 1999, small-time
entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 
companies look for bankruptcy lawyers.Today small business owners and ordinary folks 
like you and me can use the web to achieve complete 
financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little 
work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing 
technique ever created - it's called BULK EMAIL.If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then 
you know what bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on 
DELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?
You might not want their product, but remember that 
thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a 
percentage game - every bulker who contacts you 
makes a six figure income on the Internet.  I 
guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and 
review some numbers ...If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few
dollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one
auction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a
couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand
over a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN
SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY
at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000
emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.
ZERO!Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when
hardly anyone sees your ad!Imagine that you have a decent product with a 
profit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send 
an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person 
in a thousand actually places an order, then you just 
generated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours 
of work.  It's that simple ...All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A
THOUSAND to buy your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't 
matter if you're a nineteen-year-old college student 
using a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old 
executive working from an office building in New 
York City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start 
bulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All 
it takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, 
and some basic familiarity with the Internet.I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the 
""Dot Com"" mania, and I've never looked back.  I 
started with no money, no product to sell, and only 
the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an 
opportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, 
I bought my own home - with CASH.  You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.
You don't need to be a computer nerd and no experience
whatsoever is required.  If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that
you'd jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.
So what are you waiting for?!I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer
YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you
will make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.Here goes ...Do you have basic experience with the web? 
Do you have a computer and an Internet connection?
Do you have a few hours each day of free time?  
Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards 
complete financial freedom?  If you answer YES to these questions, you could be
making $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your 
home.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats 
the 9-5 daily grind!All you need is ambition and commitment.  This
is no ""get rich quick scheme"".  You have to work
to make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do 
it.You're probably wondering if it's hard to get started.  
Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step 
how to start your first email campaign and how to
build a booming online business.  You'll be generating 
orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot
products that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay
starting an Internet business because they have 
nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.  
After reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete 
product line in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE 
not to get started! I will get you up-and-running within 
seven days. In fact ...I personally guarantee that you will start your own 
bulk email campaign less than a week after reading 
the Bulkbook!  I'll give you a toll-free phone number 
to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week; 
where else will you find that level of service?!I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting 
your very first email campaign called ""Seven Days to 
Bulk Email Success"".  This seperate guide contains a daily 
routine for you to follow with specific, exact 
instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for 
example, I teach you where to find a product to sell. 
The next day you learn how to build a fresh mailing 
list.  On the seventh day, you just click send!  Your 
very first campaign is ready to go.As a special bonus, you'll recieve a FREE copy 
of our STEALTH MASS MAILER, a very powerful bulk 
email program which retails for $49.99! I'll even
include 7 million email addresses absolutely FREE
if you order NOW!Stop wasting your money on auction listing fees, 
classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and 
never will!  If you are SERIOUS about making money 
on the Internet, bulk email is your only option.  
What are you waiting for?  Few of us are willing 
to share this knowledge, but I promise to teach 
you everything I know about bulk emailing in this 
extraordinary bulk emailer's handbook ... The Bulkbook! Once again, here's the deal.  You give me $29.99.

444,"Hi -( http://club.4tfox.com )You get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money.
Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.
And they expect you to listen to them?Enough.If you want to make money with your computer, then you should
hook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making
a large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we will
show YOU how to do the same thing.This business is done completely by internet and email, and you
can even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send
an email, you can do this.  No special ""skills"" are required.How much are we making?  Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month.
We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.
But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to 
insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,
and rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if
you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be
just the thing you are looking for.This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is
done FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,
there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -
meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase
each month also).Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a
free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you
decide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still
have that ""burning desire"" to find an opportunity that will reward
them incredibly well, if they work at it.To grab a FREE ID# and have more information, simply go to the 
 web address http://club.4tfox.com  and send me an email with following 
 informtion""Send me a free membership!""Be sure to include your:
1. First name
2. Last name
3. Email address (if different from above)We will confirm your position and send you a special report

Very Cheap ISP package and many many more,You can also go to the web address:

marketing companies I had pretty much given up on them.
This is different - there is value, integrity, and a
REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business...

459,"Hi -( http://club.4tfox.com )You get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money.
Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.
And they expect you to listen to them?Enough.If you want to make money with your computer, then you should
hook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making
a large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we will
show YOU how to do the same thing.This business is done completely by internet and email, and you
can even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send
an email, you can do this.  No special ""skills"" are required.How much are we making?  Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month.
We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.
But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to 
insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,
and rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if
you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be
just the thing you are looking for.This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is
done FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,
there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -
meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase
each month also).Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a
free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you
decide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still

464,"Mr.Vincent Nnaji,
 Standard Trust Bank Ltd,
 Lagos,Nigeria.
 Dear Sir,
 I am Mr.Vincent Nnaji, Bank Manager of Standard Trust Bank,Lagos,Nigeria. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. 
On January 6,1998 a Foreign Oil Consultant Foreign contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Mr. James Herbert made a numbered time Fixed Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$20M ( Twenty Million United States Dollars) in my branch.
Upon maturity I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. James Herbert died from an automobile accident. 
On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.James Herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$20M has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe-keeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. 
According to Nigerian Law at the expiration of 5 years the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export I am writing you because I as a public servant I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m.
 I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. All these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. 
This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the boxes. The money will be shared in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you and 5% will take care of all expenses. 
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via my private email address. 
Upon your response I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe with utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.
 Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email to indicate your interest. 
Thanks and Regards,
 MR.VINCENT NNAJI.",1
465,"Dear Sir, 
With due respect and humility I write you this letter which I believe you
would
be of great assistance to my children and I.
I got your contact through my husband commercial address book and believed
that
you must be a trust worthy and reliable person that will not like to
intimidate me
or betray my trust after hearing this news. I am a native of KONOBO in the
KEREMA
local district of SIERRA LEONE in West Africa and the wife of Late DR.
MUNDI A.
KOJO who was assassinated by the rebel forced loyal to Major John Paul
Koromah
because he was the Director General National Gold and Diamond Mining
Corporation
of Sierra Leone. Few days before my husband was assassinated, he 
instructed me
and my children (Ibrahim and Amina) to move out of Sierra Leone immediately,
before the powerful Economic community of West African States (ECOMOG)
forces
intervened, which eventually resulted into a brutal civil war. My children
and I
managed to escape to Togo through the help of my husband's friend. We came
into
Togo with some valuables including a cash sum of $25MILLION(TWENTY FIVE
MILLION
UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) in two trunks boxes which I have deposited
with a
Trust Company here in Togo and special arrangement has been made with the
currier
company who will freight the money to your country.
Meanwhile, I want to leave Togo entirely with this money for investment in
your
country because of a stable political situation there and mostly for the
future of
my children. I want you to please assist us to claim this fund from the
Trust
Company in any of their branches in Europe, after which the fund will be
deposited
into your account for investment in your country. You should also help us to
source for good investment opportunity so that we can invest wisely in your
country when the fund is finally confirmed in your account.
We have it in mind to reward you handsomely for your assistance as we have
resolved to give you 20% of the total sum for your help. But due to how I
am being
monitored by the Sierra Leonean Government Secret Agents, I will advice
you to
have the 
deal concluded with my son (IBRAHIM KOJO). Please contact my son on this
email:
ibrahimkojo@caramail.com , immediately you receive this letter to enable us
proceed in earnest towards retrieving the consignments and transferring
same into
your account.
Your private Fax and Phone is needed in this transaction for private
discussions. 
Note: There is no risk involved in this business. 
Remain Blessed,

This money is not a loan,
Trying to get money through a conventional bank can be very time consuming
and requires a lot of paperwork, only to find out that you've been denied.

requirements that banks do.
You decide how much money
you need, as long as it's a lawful amount and meets with the Government
Agencies criteria, the money is yours to keep and never has to be repaid.
This money is non taxable & interest free.

a credit check, collateral, security deposits or co-signers, you can apply
even if you have a bankruptcy or bad credit, it doesn't matter, you as
a tax payer and U.S. citizen are entitled to this money.
There are currently over
1,400 Federal Programs, 24,000 State Programs, 30,000 Private Foundations

business grants and low-interest loans;
over one-half trillion dollars in

unpredictable, and a need for even greater economic development on all
fronts, the federal government is more willing than it ever has been before
to give you the money you need to own your own business and become your
own boss!
In
spite of the perception that people should not look to the government for
help, the great government give-away programs have remained so incredibly
huge that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for
an equal share, they would each receive over $70,000.
Most
people never apply for FREE Business Grants because they somehow feel it
isn't for them, feel there's too much red-tape, or simply don't know who
to contact.The fact is, however, that people from all walks of life do
receive FREE GRANTS MONEY and other benefits from the government, and you

479,"Dear Sir/Madam,I am well confident of your capability to assist me in
a transaction for mutual benefit of both parties, ie
(me and you) I am also believing that you will not
expose or betray the trust and confidence I am about
to establish with you. I have decided to contact you
with greatest delight and personal respect.Well, I am  VICTOR SANKOH, Son to Mr.FODAY
SANKOH
who was arrested by the ECOMOG PEACE KEEPING FORCE
months ago in my country Sierra Leone.
Few days before the arrest of my father, he confided
in me and ordered me to go to his underground safe and
move out immediately, with a Deposit Agreement and
Cash Receipt he made with a security Company in
Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire where he deposited One Iron Box
containing USD$ 22 million dollars cash (Twenty Two
Million dollars).This money was made from the sell of Gold and Diamond
by my FATHER and he have already
decided to use this money for future investment of
the family before his arrest.Thereafter, I rushed down to Abidjan with these
documents and confirmed the deposit of the box by my
father. Also, I have been granted political stay as a
Refugee by the Government of Cï¿½te d'Ivoire.Meanwhile, my father have instructed me to look for a
trusted foreigner who can assist me to move out this
money from Cï¿½te d'Ivoire immediately for investment .
Based on this , I solicit for your assistance to
transfer this fund into your Account, but I will
demand for the following requirement:(1) Could you provide for me a safe Bank Account where
this fund will be transferred to in your country or
another neaarby country where taxation will not
takegreat toll on the money?(2) Could you be able to assist me to obtain my
travelling papers after this transfer to enable me
come over to meet you in your country for
theinvestment of this money?(3) Could you be able to introduce me to a profitable
business venture that would not require much technical
expertise in your country where part of this fund
willbe invested?Please, all these requirements are urgently needed as
it will enable me to establish a stronger business
relationship with you hence I will like you to be the
general overseer of the investment thereafter. I am a
Christian and I will please, want you to handle this
transaction based on the trust I have established
on you.For your assistance in this transaction, I have
decided to offer you 12% percent commission of the
total amount at the end of this business. The security
of this business is very important to me and as such,
I would like you to keep this business very
confidential. I shall be expecting your urgent reply.
Thank you and God bless you.VICTOR SANKOH--

**Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm)**
********************************""Personal Choice"" Primo Exotic Supplemental Smoking Botanical / Gnarly ""SweetGrass"" Variety / Supplemental Agenda ""Seventh Heaven"" Paradoxical Configuration for the ""significant"" Enhancement and Pleasuring of body, mind & spirit ""sensitivities"" -- Potentiated; Gnarly, whole-plant Matrix  -- Paragonic Reserve; Enigmatic Blendage Mood ""Sensitive / Responsive"" Smoking / Brewing Herba.Actions & indications: Simultaneous, High-Spirited; ""Stimulation / Relaxation / Aphrodisia"" (Significant Paradise Consequence!)This is the Personal Choice, Sensitive, Responsive Smoking (""Smoka"") product we have wanting to offer! This is the product and the VALUE that you have been searching for. This is the product that you will buy again & again!We have been in the business (science) of developing non-cannabis, personal choice sensitive smoking agendas for a good, goodly while. Along this avenue of ethnobotany, we have always strived to achieve greater and greater ""Sensitivity / Responsiveness"" & Aphrodisia within our gourmet smokables and brews. And indeed, we have. Many of these previous products are still marketed today by companies who are less developmental than our botanical resource cooperative. Even our own two signature ""smokables"" (Ragga Dagga & Stoney Mahoney) are being discontinued. That Shangrila Zowie Wowie is by far such a superior product is undeniable, therefore it makes no sense to us at all to offer any other smoking product. Quite simply we have surpassed even our own expectations of excellence, thereby; our definition of excellence has evolved. This ""Shangrila"" project has been in research and development for sometime on two fronts. First, on an agricultural level, fields for our Gnarly SweetGrass!
 must be planted and be allowed to propagate for several years before initial harvest can even be undertaken. This is how the botanical achieves ""potent significance"" much like the regimen of ginseng. Also, harvest time is limited and can take place only twice a year, as like the hemp plant, maximum potency is only achieved after ""flowering"" occurs. But, unlike the hemp plant, and for that matter, unlike most herbs, the entire base plant of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (leave, stem & root) is all ""viripotent,"" which makes this ""gnarly stoke"" a botanical phenomenon! As well, most potentiating factors of Shangrila, as well as the primary botanical factor of Shangrila, will not achieve ""viripotency"" if grown in our hemisphere, therefore; Shangrila is indeed a multi-national, multi-complicated, agricultural undertaking. However, all of this undertaking has indeed been worthwhile! Secondly, the potentiating, infusion regimen used to enhance the attributes of Shangrila has also taken a lon!
g time to bring into potent fruition as there are many balancings of the various molecular factors involved in the completion of Zowie Wowie. We are most pleased to be able to say, as you will note in the experience of Shangrila Zowie Wowie, that this process has achieved fruition.Suffice to say, without any hype or glype, Shangrila Zowie Wowie Gnarly SweetGrass is without a doubt, the most significant, non-invasive, non-cannabis, ""sensitive/responsive"", personal choice, absolutely legal (cannot fail a drug test), smoking (""Smoka"") botanical on our planet ... probably in the universe! Hard to believe that this product is ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!* Mill-stoned & honed.
* Depressive regressive!
* Psychologically uplifting!
* Good-bye stress, anxiety & restlessness!
* Sophisticated, well-balanced ""ambiance.""
* Inspires contemplativeness and creativity.
* ""Potentiated"" & viripotent!
* 4 â€“ 5 draws lasts a good, goodly while.

* Simultaneously; uplifting and relaxing!
* Easy ignition, Smooth draw, Sweet, heady taste.
* Easy on, easy off!
* SATISFACTION GUARANTEED!
* No ""munchie"" factor.
* No failed drug tests!Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) Gnarly ""SweetGrass"" botanical is best utilized as a viri-potent ""Smoka"", via an herb-pipe. As is an herbalist's way, four or five draws of ""Smoka"" should be inhaled and retained. For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage this herbaceousness as a potentiated tea/brew. (Steep approximately one teaspoon of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.) When smoking Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm), please draw gently as it is a most preeminent ""Sensitive / Responsive"" Smoke.

Discover The Best Kept Secret In America!Turning $300 Into $20,000In Oklahoma, Craig
Talkington purchased a Tax Lien on a 5 acre parcel for
$300. The owner failed to pay the taxes and forfeited
the 5-acre parcel to Craig Talkington. A short time
later Craig sold that property to one of the neighbors
for $20,000. That's the kind of money that buys new
cars and sends young people to college. Craig didn't
stop at one deal. He later bought a tax lien for only
$17 on a ten acre track, the property owner failed to
pay the taxes, and Craig ended up the property, which
he sold for $4,000. I don't know how much money you
are making right now but these are the kinds of
profits that change peoples lives and solve financial
problems and make things a lot better.

FROM:MR. DESMOND STEVENS                     URGENT ASSISTANCE. 
YOU MAY BE SURPRISED TO RECEIVE THIS LETTER FROM ME SINCE YOU DO NOT KNOW ME PERSONALLY. I AM MR.DESMOND STEVENS, THE FIRST SON OF DR. DENNIS STEVENS, WHO WAS RECENTLY MURDERED IN THE LAND DISPUTE IN ZIMBABWE. I WAS FURNISHED WITH VIABLE INFORMATION FROM THE WORLD TRADE CENTRE HERE IN AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS AND DECIDED TO WRITE YOU. 
BEFORE THE DEATH OF MY FATHER, HE HAD TAKEN ME TO AMSTERDAM TO DEPOSIT THE SUM OF TEN MILLION,FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS (US$10,500,000) IN A SECURITY COMPANY, AS IF HE FORESAW THE LOOMING DANGER IN ZIMBABWE. THIS MONEY WAS DEPOSITED IN A BOX AS GEMSTONES TO AVOID MUCH DEMURRAGE FROM THE SECURITY COMPANY. THIS AMOUNT WAS MEANT FOR THE PURCHASE OF NEW MACHINES AND CHEMICALS FOR THE FARMS AND ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW FARM IN SWAZILAND. THIS LAND PROBLEM CAME WHEN ZIMBABWE PRESIDENT MR. ROBERT MUGABE, INTRODUCED A NEW LAND ACT THAT WHOLLY AFFECTED RICH WHITE FARMERS AND SOME FEW BLACK FARMERS. THIS RESULTED TO THE KILLING AND MOB ACTION BY ZIMBABWE WAR VETERANS AND SOME LUNATICS IN THE SOCIETY. INFACT, A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE KILLED BECAUSE OF THIS LAND REFORM ACT OF WHICH MY FATHER WAS ONE OF THE VICTIMS. IT IS AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND THAT MY FAMILY AND I WHO ARE CURRENTLY STAYING IN AMSTERDAM DECIDED TO TRANSFER MY FATHERï¿½S MONEY TO 
 A FOREIGN ACCOUNT. SINCE THE LAW OF THE NETHERLANDS PROHIBIT A REFUGEE (ASYLUM SEEKER) TO OPEN ANY ACCOUNT OR TO BE INVOLVED IN ANY FINANCIAL TRANSACTION. 
AS THE ELDEST SON OF MY FATHER, I AM SADDLED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SEEKING A GENUINE FOREIGN ACCOUNT WHERE THIS MONEY COULD BE TRANSFERRED WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF MY GOVERNMENT WHO ARE BENT ON TAKING EVERYTHING WE HAVE GOT. I AM FACED WITH THE DILEMMA OF INVESTING THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE NETHERLANDS FOR THE FEAR OF GOING THROUGH THE SAME EXPERIENCE IN FUTURE SINCE BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE SIMILAR HISTORY. MOREOVER, THE NETHERLANDS FOREIGN EXCHANGE POLICY DOES NOT ALLOW SUCH INVESTMENT FROM ASYLUM SEEKERS. AS A BUSINESSMAN, WHOM I HAVE ENTRUSTED MY FUTURE AND MY FAMILY IN HIS HANDS, I MUST LET YOU KNOW THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS RISK FREE. IF YOU ACCEPT TO ASSIST ME AND MY FAMILY, ALL I NEED YOU TO DO FOR ME IS TO MAKE ARRANGEMENT AND COME TO AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS SO THAT YOU CAN OPEN THE NON-RESIDENT ACCOUNT WHICH WILL AID US IN TRANSFERRING THE MONEY INTO ANY ACCOUNT YOU WILL NOMINATE OVERSEAS. THIS MONEY I INTEND TO USE FOR INVESTMENT. I HAVE
  OPTIONS TO OFFER YOU, FIRST YOU CAN CHOOSE TO HAVE CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE MONEY FOR NOMINATING YOUR ACCOUNT FOR THE TRANSACTION, OR YOU CAN GO INTO PARTNERSHIP WITH ME FOR A PROPER PROFITABLE INVESTMENT OF THE MONEY IN YOUR COUNTRY. WHICHEVER OPTION YOU CHOOSE, FEEL FREE TO NOTIFY ME. I HAVE MAPPED OUT 5% OF THIS MONEY FOR ALL EXPENSES INCURRED IN PROCESSING THIS TRANSACTION. IF YOU DO NOT PREFER A PARTNERSHIP, I AM WILLING TO GIVE YOU 25% OF THE MONEY WHILE THE REMAINING 70% THAT IS MEANT FOR ME, WILL BE FOR THE INVESTMENT IN YOUR COUNTRY. 
PLEASE, CONTACT ME WITH THE ABOVE TELEPHONE AND E-MAIL ADDRESS, WHILE I IMPLORE YOU TO MAINTAIN THE ABSOLUTE SECRECY REQUIRED IN THE TRANSACTION. 
YOURS FAITHFULLY, 
DESMOND STEVENS. --

            eBay Marketing e-Course...Â Â                   Learn To
 Sell With the Complete eBayÂ™                   
Auction Marketing e-Course 
Here's 
                  YOUR Chance To Join The Online
                  Selling Revolution And EARN A FULL TIME  INCOME! Our eBay                    Marketing e-Course will show you how to create 
HUGE profits selling on eBay!Â Do you sell on eBay? If so, you could be making up
to $100,000 per month.                  This is no hype and no scam. Receiving over 1.5 billion page views per
month, eBay is the ULTIMATE venue for selling virtually anything and making
huge profits with almost no effort. But you have to know what to sell and
how to sell. That's where I come in.                  As a leading expert in internet marketing and the owner of several profitable
auction-based businesses, the manual that I have written provides easy to
understand and detailed instructions for maximizing your profits with selling
strategies that are PROVEN WINNERS.                  If you've read any other books on eBay, you know that all of them are designed
for the computer idiot and the auction novice. They tell you how to register,
how to list an item, how to avoid fraud, etc. This is not the information
you need to make millions on eBay. You need to learn effective SELLING STRATEGIES
not read a photocopy of eBay help files! My manual assumes that you already
know your way around eBay; you don't need any specialized computer knowledge,
but you should be familiar with buying and selling on eBay auctions. I'm
not going to waste your time teaching you how to register - I'm going to
pass on the SECRET SELLING TECHNIQUES that I use each and every day to bring
in hundreds of thousands of dollars selling my products on internet auctions.
The manual comes as a complete course with the following lessons:Make a Fortune on eBayÂ™Â 
 Make a Fortune on                    eBayÂ™ is filled with page after page

 Judgment Courses offers an extensive Audio training
course in 
 ""How to Collect Money Judgments""
  .          S6 If you are like many people, you are not even sure what a
Money Judgment is and 
 why processing Money Judgments
can earn you very substantial income
  .If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you
will have a Money Judgment against them.You are happy you won but you will soon find out the
shocking fact: ""Its now up to you to collect on the
Judgment"". The court does not require the loser to pay you.
The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser
down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,
real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do
when they are found. The result is that millions of
Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.""In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a
dime.""The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic
proportions. Right now in the United States there is
between 
 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollected Money
Judgment debt
  . For every Judgment that is paid, 5 more
Judgments take its place.We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have
actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this
business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid
profession in which only a select few will be trained in the
techniques necessary to succeed.With our first hand experience we have built a course which
teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown
and exciting field of processing Money Judgments.By following the steps laid out in our course and with
reasonable effort you can become very successful in the
processing of Money Judgments.The income potential is substantial in this profession. 
 We
have associates who have taken our course and are now
working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per
year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00
and $100,000.00 per year 
 . Some choose to operate out of
their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable
organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business
offices.Today our company and our associates have over 126
million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently
processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form
of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.
Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break
even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on
the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting
capability is so extensive that government agencies, police
officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us
for reports.
Many of our associates already have real estate liens in
force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.
Legally this means that when the properties are sold or
refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%
interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.
Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to
$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the
payment of the principal.Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per
year. This is just for interest, not counting principle
and not counting the compounding of the interest which can
add substantial additional income. Typically companies are
sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest
an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell
their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.
 92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43%
are women and 36% are part time
  .One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are
not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off
for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are
working on will be there when you return. The Judgments
are still in force, they do not disappear.The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your
computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You
never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you
are. You are not a collection agency.Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing
are as follows:Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals
with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who
to write to)8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you
and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them
unless you want to.You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to
sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and
50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for
$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor
and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to
assist you. They range from credit reports from all three
credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment
locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.
The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to
1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge
$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other
companies charge $25.00.Once you find the debtor and their assets you file
garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.
(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the
course)When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to
the original Judgment holder.Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of
Judgment to the court. (Included in the course)Quote's from several of our students:Thomas in area code 516 writes us: ""I just wanted to drop
you a short note thanking you for your excellent course. 
 My
first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars
  . Your
professionalism in both the manual and the video opened
doors for me in the future. There's no stopping me now.
Recently Thomas states he has over $8,500,000 worth of
judgments he is working on.After only having this course for four months, Larry S. in
area code 314 stated to us: "" 
 I am now making $2,000.00 per
week 
 and expect this to grow to twice this amount within the
next year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in
judgments I am collecting on now.""After having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated
"" 
 I am now making $12,000.00
  per month and have approximately
$500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I
will have to hire someone to help out""Marshal in area code 407 states to us ""I feel bad, you only
charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I
have added 3 full time people to help me after only having
your course for 5 months"">From the above information and actual results you can see
why we can state the following:With our course you can own your own successful business.
A business which earns you substantial income now and one
which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to
retire on and travel the world. A business which is
extremely interesting to be in. A Business in which every
day is new and exciting.None of your days will be hum-drum. Your brain is
Challenged. A business, which protects you from Corporate
Downsizing. A business which you can start part time from
your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full
time. A business, which is your ticket to freedom from
others telling you what to do. A business, which lets you
control your own destiny. Our training has made this happen
for many others already. Make it happen for you!If the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you
to talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation
on your part.
 Please call us at 1_406_652_0194 
 .We have 
 Customer Support staff available to you from 8:00am to
9:00pm (Mountain Time) 7 days a week
  . If you call this number
you can talk to one of our experienced Customer Support personnel.
They can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation.
Sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations
of courses. When you call our Customer Support line they can let
you know of any specials we may be running. If you like what you
read and hear about our courses, then the Customer Support person
can work with you to place your order. We are very low key. We
merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to
work with us or not.Thank you for your time and interest.

do business worldwide via the Internet. Chinese makers of porcelain, for 
example, can deal direct with US consumers and retailers. Say ""goodbye"" to 
the layers of middlemen.CMNW strives to become a World Wide Wholesaler CMNW is attempting to become an International wholesaler to the world. This
is an enormous goal. Many believe that trade with China built the world's greatest
fortunes, from the golden age of Venice to the British Empire. Now this potential
is being transferred to the Internet, and CMNW will attempt to capture it.CMNW puts all this into your portfolio: stability of a US-based company... 
sky-rocketing China market...convenience of a US-listed stock...dynamics of 
a growth company. *** For the latest quarterly report on CMNW, go to www.freeedgar.com *** Obviously, you cannot go back in time to the year 1901 and invest in baby US 
companies like Coca-Cola and Johnson & Johnson as they were getting started. 
But you can grab the modern day equivalent. That's right. The growth 
potential in China at this very minute is like the United States at the start 
of the 20th century -- perhaps even greater. There's much more to the CMNW story. Including a major expansion into Mexico. To SUBSCRIBE to the future communications, please click on this link and hit send:

Dear Friend,This last summer, our family had a big reunion at a fabulous resort in 
Minnesota. Â The water was sapphire blue and the evergreens sang as the 
breeze rustled their limbs. Â We had such a great time renewing old 
friendships, seeing how everyone's children had grown, and catching up on 
everyone's lives. Â The last day we had a family picture taken, thinking 
that we'd all send them out as our Christmas cards.In October we got the proofs back so that we could pick our favorite picture. 
Everybody looked wonderful and the background was spectacular but I could not 
find myself in the picture. Â I looked and looked and finally got out a 
magnifying glass. Â To my horror, I found this dark curly headed woman 
with a face that looked like a stretched moon!!! Â Dear God it was me!!! 
Â My body resembled an inflated hot air balloon that would take off should 
a heavy wind arise... it was HIDEOUS! Â I had mirrors in my house but most of them were 
designed to only reflect Â from the waist up and I honestly hadn't noticed 
that my cheekbones had totally disappeared and that my face looked like a 
shapeless clump of flesh. Â I was always so happy that I didn't have a lot 
of wrinkles, Â but I didn't realize that I wasn't wrinkled because my skin 
was as stretched as tight as a bongo drum.Well, this situation was NOT  acceptable. Â But I was at a loss as to what to do. 
Â My willpower, well, basically sucks and I had so-o-o much weight to lose 
that I wasn't sure I'd live long enough to get it all off. Â Plus, I hate 
diets and can only stick to them for a very short period of time before I fall 
off the food wagon. Â My goal to slim down seemed totally hopeless.AND THEN 
IT HAPPENED. Â I received a brochure about a product called 
BERRY TRIM 
PLUS. Â It seemed to contain everything I needed. Â 
It curbs your appetite, increases energy, burns fat at the fastest rate 
possible, no special diets are required, you don't have to exercise like a 
lunatic, it doesn't make you feel speeded, Â AND IT 'S ALL NATURAL WITH NO 
ADVERSE SIDE EFFECTS. Â It also was priced well below other products so 
I figured that if it didn't work I wouldn't be out much money. Â It is 
guaranteed, but I'm always too lazy to bother to send back the empty bottles 
so this diet supplement seemed perfect for me.It's been about 6 weeks now but I swear I'm beginning to look like that 
famous Cindy person that models. Â My cheekbones are absolutely glorious.. 
I swear I look like a new person and a good one at that. Â BERRY TRIM 
PLUS  also keeps your skin tight so you don't look like a 
Shar Pei with nasty folds of skin hanging all around after you lose the weight.
I promise you that this product works. Â It does everything it promises 
and then some. Â Just losing the weight alone, makes you feel so much 
better and younger. Â It puts zest back into your life and assures you 
that you'll achieve your weight loss goals. Â In another few weeks I will 
reach my goal...something I had given up on. Â Also, HLNA  offers an affiliate 
program so you might as well make a few bucks while losing those pounds.

OPRAH, NIGHTLINE, MARIA SHRIVER, 48 HOURS, 20/20, 
PLAYBOY, KIPLINGERS and more have all interviewed this 
FAMOUS Private Investigator, seeking to find how he made 
his fortune.  Take a moment and learn his long sought after SECRETS.This PI is the originator of seeking out Judicial Judgments and using 
them to make a FORTUNE!  Most people have no idea what a 
Judicial Judgment is, much less how to process them to earn a very 
substantial income.Hereï¿½s the SCOOP-  When one person or business files suit against 
another and wins, the winner then has a JUDICIAL JUDGMENT.
BUT, even though they won- guess what? They soon find out these 
SHOCKING FACTS:a) Its now up to them to Collect on the Judgment
b) The court does not require the loser to pay you. 
c) The court will not help you to collect it. 
d) Employees of the court are FORBIDDEN BY LAW from telling 
you how to collect the judgment. All the winner really has is a WORTHLESS piece of paper. They 
must trace the loser down, find their assets; their employment, bank 
accounts, real estate, stocks and bonds, etc. And THE WINNER 
has to pay all the expenses to find this out.  All of a sudden that 
BIG CASH SETTLEMENT the person got, has become an 
expense instead of an asset!  WHAT HAPPENS THEN?- MILLIONS of Judgments just sit in 
files and become forgotten. people give up trying.  Right now in the 
United States there are between 200 and 300 BILLION dollars of 
uncollected JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs. For every Judgment that is paid, 
5 or more unpaid Judgments take its place. So how does this Private Investigator make a FORTUNE collecting 
other peopleï¿½s judgments?  Thatï¿½s what we want to tell you.  
Through long and hard work, this Sleuth has learned a 
process that will turn these forgotten useless pieces of paper 
into a FORTUNE without the high collection cost.The income potential is substantial in this profession! Using the 
techniques taught in his course , people are now working full-time 
making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per year. Part-time 
associates are earning between $24,000.00 and $100,000.00 per 
year. Most choose to work out of their homes, others build sizable 
organizations.Today, people trained in this business opportunity are processing 
over 500 million dollars in JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs!  AND, 
new judgments become available every day.  The work is
ALWAYS there, you just need to know how to go about it. 
This is a GREAT OPPORTUNITY for anyone who wants to start 
something ï¿½on the sideï¿½ that will offer a solid income in the future. 
It is also ideal because you determine how much time you want to 
spend doing this and when. Make no mistake though-THIS IS NOT 
A GET RICH QUICK SCHEME. It requires effort on your part.  
The more effort the bigger the reward.  You choose how much you 
want to make!If you've ever dreamed the American Dream financial freedom 
this may very well be the opportunity youï¿½ve been looking for.  
This business can also protect you from corporate downsizing. 
It might also be your ticket to freedom from others telling you what
to do. This business lets you control your destiny! You donï¿½t need 
to be a rocket scientist either! Our training has made this happen for 
many others already. Make it happen for you too!Take the first step and talk it over with one of our trained

OPRAH, NIGHTLINE, MARIA SHRIVER, 48 HOURS, 20/20, 
PLAYBOY, KIPLINGERS and more have all interviewed this 
FAMOUS Private Investigator, seeking to find how he made 
his fortune.  Take a moment and learn his long sought after SECRETS.This PI is the originator of seeking out Judicial Judgments and using 
them to make a FORTUNE!  Most people have no idea what a 
Judicial Judgment is, much less how to process them to earn a very 
substantial income.Hereï¿½s the SCOOP-  When one person or business files suit against 
another and wins, the winner then has a JUDICIAL JUDGMENT.
BUT, even though they won- guess what? They soon find out these 
SHOCKING FACTS:a) Its now up to them to Collect on the Judgment
b) The court does not require the loser to pay you. 
c) The court will not help you to collect it. 
d) Employees of the court are FORBIDDEN BY LAW from telling 
you how to collect the judgment. All the winner really has is a WORTHLESS piece of paper. They 
must trace the loser down, find their assets; their employment, bank 
accounts, real estate, stocks and bonds, etc. And THE WINNER 
has to pay all the expenses to find this out.  All of a sudden that 
BIG CASH SETTLEMENT the person got, has become an 
expense instead of an asset!  WHAT HAPPENS THEN?- MILLIONS of Judgments just sit in 
files and become forgotten. people give up trying.  Right now in the 
United States there are between 200 and 300 BILLION dollars of 
uncollected JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs. For every Judgment that is paid, 
5 or more unpaid Judgments take its place. So how does this Private Investigator make a FORTUNE collecting 
other peopleï¿½s judgments?  Thatï¿½s what we want to tell you.  
Through long and hard work, this Sleuth has learned a 
process that will turn these forgotten useless pieces of paper 
into a FORTUNE without the high collection cost.The income potential is substantial in this profession! Using the 
techniques taught in his course , people are now working full-time 
making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per year. Part-time 
associates are earning between $24,000.00 and $100,000.00 per 
year. Most choose to work out of their homes, others build sizable 
organizations.Today, people trained in this business opportunity are processing 
over 500 million dollars in JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs!  AND, 
new judgments become available every day.  The work is
ALWAYS there, you just need to know how to go about it. 
This is a GREAT OPPORTUNITY for anyone who wants to start 
something ï¿½on the sideï¿½ that will offer a solid income in the future. 
It is also ideal because you determine how much time you want to 
spend doing this and when. Make no mistake though-THIS IS NOT 
A GET RICH QUICK SCHEME. It requires effort on your part.  
The more effort the bigger the reward.  You choose how much you 
want to make!If you've ever dreamed the American Dream financial freedom 
this may very well be the opportunity youï¿½ve been looking for.  
This business can also protect you from corporate downsizing. 
It might also be your ticket to freedom from others telling you what
to do. This business lets you control your destiny! You donï¿½t need 
to be a rocket scientist either! Our training has made this happen for 
many others already. Make it happen for you too!Take the first step and talk it over with one of our trained 
counselors by calling 1-720-733-7315.  Let them answer your 
questions so that youï¿½ll know if itï¿½s right for you.  There is no cost 
or obligation on your part except the cost of a phone call.  Join a small number of people who are reaping the BIG

I do not like pop up pagesand therewasone that kept doing that. Some of the pages were really pretty but theanimationdid not fit the mood of the page. A tremendous amout of work hasbeenput into the page. There are so many places to host websites inexpensively,whydon't you have your own domain? You ought to check into that.~~~~Thisis a very lovely site, the graphics are awesome and the games are funaswell. You may want to look into purchasing your own domain name andahost that offers bannerless hosting (at least without the pop-ups).~~~~Hmm...too much input! There's way too much loading on this page. I don'tlikethe wav file loading and though I didn't here anything windows promptedmefor a MP3 decoder, so I presume one of those was loading as well. Someofthe links are pretty cool but perhaps the main menu should be also textbasedor smaller gifs and put on the index page. For a minute I didn't knowwhereto go.~~~~Thiswas a neat site.ï¿½ The site was original and I could tell that Mrs.T certainlyseemsto enjoy working on her site.ï¿½ The graphics were pretty, or funny,dependingon each one, but well arranged. But, the text on the home pagewasgoing from the left side to the right side with no margins so it overlappedtheleft rose border. I'd suggest moving the margins in a little bit.ï¿½Also, I thinkusinga sans-serif font like arial would be easier to read, though I did likehowthefont color matched the flowers. BTW, I was viewing the site with internetexplorer.Idon't think you need the 'welcome' on both the home page and the site guidepage,it's overkill. I also didn't figure out the association between mrstgifts,interactiveopinions, and a site on graphics. Relating the name of your site tothesite content helps when new visitors visit.Onyour home page you say something about trying to design your own graphics.Ifyou do so, try starting with a logo for your site. I realize you are showingdifferentpictures and styles, but it would be nice to have a logo or the samepictureon each page so it's easy to tell I'm still visiting the same website.Onyourarticles page it was hard to see the titles by the earth graphics becauseofthe background colors. Maybe putting them in a table with the backgroundbehindthat would work better.Lookfor a host that doesn't use pop-ups - I would have checked out morepagesbut I hated getting those pop-ups each time I clicked to a new page.Iwent to your articles site and that was at homestead - that bar is mucheasiertodeal with than the pop-ups. I'd suggest moving your whole site there.~~~~Thisis an interesting site - it covers a large variety of subjects - not allof whichIvisited - and it has something for every member of the family, however,mostofit is for either mothers or the kids. She even has some games to play -goodforsmaller kids, too! Mrs. T., as she is known, is quite creative - and Iwouldrecommendthis site for the whole family.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~VOTEON YOUR FAVORITE WEBSITE DESIGN!Helpout the winner of the free website redesign by voting forYOURfavorite!Youcan help out Teddy at http://www.links4profit.comby taking alookat his site, then checking out the three new layouts Jana ofAkkaBayDesigns http://AkkaBay.com has designedspecificallyforhim.ï¿½ After you've visited all three, vote for your favorite.Tomake this as easy as possible for you, just click on the e-mailaddressthat matches your choice - you do not need to enteranyinformation in the subject or body of the message.Ihave included a note from Jana, and the links to Teddy'scurrentsite along with the three new designs:FromJana: The pages have been created as non-frame pagesalthoughwith minor modification, the pages could be adaptedforuse in a frames environmentPleasetake a look at the existing site: http://www.links4profit.comHereare the 3 redesigns:http://AkkaBay.com/links4profit/index.htmlVotefor this design:ï¿½ mailto:design1@AEOpublishing.comhttp://AkkaBay.com/links4profit/index2.htmlVotefor this design:ï¿½ mailto:design2@AEOpublishing.comhttp://AkkaBay.com/links4profit/index3.htmlVotefor this design:ï¿½ mailto:design3@AEOpublishing.comYouwill have all of this week to vote (through June 29), andwe'lllist the favorite and most voted for layout next week.Teddyof course will be able to choose his favorite, andcolors,font style/size, backgrounds, textures, etc, can alleasilybe changed on the ""layout"" that they like.Freewebsite re-designs and original graphics are provided toRedesignwinners courtesy of AkkaBay Designs. http://AkkaBay.comIfyou have any questions about how this works or how you canparticipate,please email Amy at Moderator@AEOpublishing.com______________________________________________________moderator:Amy Mosselposting:ï¿½MyInput@AEOpublishing.com____________________________________________________________________________________________________________Sendposts and questions (or your answers) to:ï¿½ï¿½mailto:MyInput@AEOpublishing.comPleasesend suggestions and comments to:ï¿½ï¿½mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.comTochange your subscribed address, send both newandold address to mailto:Moderator@AEOpublishing.comSeebelow for unsubscribe instructions.Copyright2001 AEOpublishing-----End of Your Membership Exchangeï¿½ï¿½Visit our Subscription Center to edit your interests or unsubscribe.View our privacy policy.This email was sent to those who signed up for it.

#263 SANDTON CITY
JOHANNESBURG,SOUTH AFRICA.
E-MAIL: joel_rose1@mail.com
ATTN:ALHAJIWith due respect, trust and humility, I write you this
proposal, which I believe, would be of great interest
to you. I am Mrs. regina Rossman, the wife of late Mr.
Joseph Rossman of blessed memory, before forces loyal
to
Major Johnny Paul Koromah killed my husband; he was
the Director General of Gold and Mining Corporation
(G.D.M.C.) of Sierra Leone. My husband was one of the
people targeted by the rebel forces. On the course of
the revolution in the country, prominent people were
hijacked from their homes to an unknown destination.Two days before his death, he managed to sneak a
written message to us, explaining his condition and
concerning one trunk box of valuables containing
money, which he concealed under the roof. He
instructed me to take our son and move out of Sierra
Leone, immediately to any neighboring country. The
powerful peace keeping force of the ï¿½(ECOMOG)ï¿½
intervened to arrest the situation of mass killings by
the rebels, which was the order of the day.
Eventually, it resulted into full war, I became a
widow overnight, helpless situation, without a partner
at the moment of calamity, and every person was
running for his life. My son and I managed to escape
to South Africa safely with the box and some documents
of property title.The cash involved inside the box was US$30 Million
(Thirty Million United States Dollars). Due to fear
and limited rights as a refugee, I deposited the items
with a private security company in order not to raise
an eyebrow over the box here in South Africa in my
sonï¿½s name JOEL R. ROSSMAN. Be informed that the real
content of the box was not disclosed. Meanwhile, I
want to travel out of South Africa entirely with this
money for investment in your country because of
political and economic stability and for future
benefit of my child.
I want you to assist us claim this box from the
security company and get the money into your private
account in your country so that we can invest the
money wisely. We have in mind to establish a rewarding
investment and good relationship with you.
Concerning the money, we are prepared to give you
reasonable percentage of 30% for your kind assistance.
Also, we have decided to set aside 5% of the total sum
for expenses that might be incurred by the parties in
the course of the transfer both locally and
externally. For the interest of this business, do not
hesitate to contact my son Mr. JOEL R. ROSSMAN on the
above e-mail address immediately you
receive this message for more information and to
enable
us proceed towards concluding all our arrangements. No
other person knows about this money apart from my son
and I. We await your most urgent response.please we
need your fax/phone numbers for esiear communication.Thanking you for your co-operation and God bless you.
Best regard,MRS. REGINA ROSSMAN.

THANK'S TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET ! ================================================== BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you 
have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of 
this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted 
an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see 
if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or 
not the program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws 
prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow the 
simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only 
$25 out of pocket cost''. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF 
POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, 
IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. This is what one had to say: ''Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I 
was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am 
so gladI finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the 
minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total $ 
610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in."" 
Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. =================================================== Here is another testimonial: ""This program has been around for a long 
time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again 
in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple 
instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. 
First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made 
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the 
program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The 
key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change 
anything.'' More testimonials later but first, ===== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTUREREFERENCE ====== $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

problems. === When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports. 
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer 
and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00. Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from 
these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be 
accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them 
from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in 
case something happen to your computer. IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next 
to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is 
instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will loose out on majority 
of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see 
how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been 
tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People have tried to put their 
friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But 
it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy and then 
nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is 
instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you.
 
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! 1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and 
REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person 
has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune. 
2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. 
3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. 
4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. 
5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. PLEASE MAKE 
SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! ========================================================== **** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your 
computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. 
Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with 
marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide 
you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk 
e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. 
There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going: 
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY ==========================================================
 
Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will 
assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's 
also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response 
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people 
will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). 
Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% 
response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded 
by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 
e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded and 
ordered Report # 2
. 
Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. 
The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails 
sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.
 
Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 
(50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report 
# 5
 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million).
 
Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3..... $5,000 + 4 
... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand Total=$555,550.00 NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGUREOUT 
THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU 
CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY !
 
========================================================= REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE 
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. 
Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even 
one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are 
over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, 
many people will do just that, and more! 
METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ======================================================= Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds 
of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will 
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 
and dd METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you 
must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide 
same day service on all orders. 
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and 
address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they 
receivethe report. =========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ==================== ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: 
Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT 
accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets 
of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME 
of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name 
and postal address. PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW : ==================================================== REPORT # 1: ""The Insider's Guide to Advertising for Free on the Net""

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$ Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: === If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 
weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. 
=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you 
should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, 
continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. 
=== Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU 
CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the 
cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: 
Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front 
of a Different report. 
You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report 
people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE 
INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START 
THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. 
There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!! ====================================================== FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS 
PROGRAM: You have just received information that can give you 
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST 
A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next 
few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program 
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works 
exceedingly well as it is now. 
Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put 
your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 ...........# 5 
as instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 
100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them. 
Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers 
you will reach. 
So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and 
opportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW ! ============ MORE TESTIMONIALS ================ ""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an 
accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. 
When I received this program I grumbled to Jodyaboutreceiving ''junk 
mail''. I made fun of the whole thing,spoutingmy knowledge of the population 
and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored 
my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I 
made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on 
her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks 
she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received 
total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jody 
in her ''hobby''. 
Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois ====================================================== ''Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my 
mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that 
the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I 
wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was 
surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with 
orders. I made $319,210.00in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about 
this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a 
better investment with a faster return and so big."" 
Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada ======================================================= ''I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered 
if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to 
get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone 
else.........11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not 
delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the 
money came within 22 weeks."" 
Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. ======================================================= ''It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with 
little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and 
within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made 
$20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was 
$362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet."".

 Here is a sample of just a few of the letters we receive every week 
thanking us for what our product has done:  ""I am astounded! The day before I started taking the GH1, 
I took blood tests. Then I began using the GH1 as directed. 
After 8 weeks I took blood tests again. 
My IGF-1 level (evidence of GH) showed a 70% increase! 
Furthermore, my cholesterol score went from 190 down to 144! 
I definitely feel better overall and certainly have more energy. 
To say the least I am very impressed and pleased with GH1. 
My ""biological"" age is now that of a 40 year old!"" 
-Dr. A. Zuckerman M.D., age 60, NY ""A year ago, my blood pressure was 180/120 and I was on blood 
pressure medication. I also started the Anti-Aging formula, GH1. 
After a year on the product, my blood pressure is now 120/80-- 
and I haven't been on the blood pressure medication for months!"" 
-Susanne Peters, Laguna Beach, CA ""After 2 weeks on Anti-Aging Formula GH1, I noticed a higher 
level of energy, increased sexual energy and my memory and vision 
were enhanced. My blood pressure is down to 126/84 after workout-and 
it seems every other day I have to 'rev-up' the amps on the treadmill 
at the gym. I've noticed a tightening of the skin under my chin and 
a change in my lungs with much easier breathing. After 4 months, 
I only need 5 hours sleep instead of 7. One morning, I had to do an extra 
karate workout just to expend all the extra energy!"" ""After 6 months on 
GH1, my blood sugar levels went from 130 down to 65! Also, my stamina has 
increased, as well as my energy and sex drive--this product is GREAT!"" 
-Dr. Richard Boyd, 78 years old, Harvard Clinical Psychologist, CA ""As a straight-ahead bicycle racer, I used to have to wait a minute 
and a half after sprinting, for my heart rate to come down to where 
I could sprint again. After a month on GH1, I can now sprint again 
after only 45 seconds! GH1 cut my waiting time in half!"" 
-Ed Caz, age 40, Fresno,CA ""When I heard GH1 would reduce body fat increase lean muscle WITHOUT EXERCISE, I couldn't believe it--but in just a few months I lost 4 inches around my waist without exercising and my body fat went from 22 down to 19--even though I gained 10 pounds! Also, after 4 months, my fine vision returned. I no longer need the magnifying glasses to read fine print."" 
-Larry Baker, age 54,Oceanside, CA ""I have been taking Anti-Aging Formula GH1 for five months now. 
I have been under great stress in my business. 
I believe that taking Anti-Aging Formula GH1 has had a big part in keeping 
my energy level up and having the strength to stay positive in the midst 
of discouraging circumstances. Last week I came down with a cold. 
Colds are tough on me and seem to run their course- headaches, sinus inflammation, and then throat. I am progressing through those stages but more quickly than before. Hallelujah! My eyes aren't as puffy and the skin on my hands snaps back faster. 
My muscles seem to have better tone-I notice it in my legs-and I have more energy 
when I go out walking."" 
- Carolyn Munn ""I was taking injections of GH for over one year. A friend suggested that 
I try Anti-Aging Formula GH1, since I was spending 1,000 US dollars a month and needed 
a doctor to inject it daily. In 2-3 weeks I felt better from the Anti-Aging 
Formula GH1 than the whole time I was getting the injections. 
Thank you Anti-Aging Formula for greatly helping to improve my life!"" 
-Rita Mills McCoy ""I have had elevated cholesterol levels since the first time I was tested, 
in my twenties. I was on Anti-Aging Formula GHI for only 1 month when my levels 
dropped from 245 to 210. I could hardly believe it! After 3 months on Anti-Aging 
Formula GH1 my gray hair began to darken at the roots, returning to its normal 
coloring. I have even been able to reduce my thyroid medication. All of this 
without having to change anything else about my lifestyle, other than taking 
few sprays of Anti-Aging Formula GH1 a day. Wow! 
-Alan Ross, 43 years old GH1 is the highest concentration of orally administered GH1 
available on the market today. Injections of GH taken in international units are usually prescribed to be taken as a shot, two times per day. The individual would be taking between 2 and 4 units per day. GH1 has over 2000ng per dosage and was created to imitate the body's natural secretion of GH.  
 WHAT IS GROWTH HORMONE (GH)? Growth hormone is a naturally occurring substance in the human body which 
is secreted by the pituitary, the master gland of the body, located in the 
endocrine system. GH is a microscopic protein substance that is chemically 
similar to insulin, which is secreted in short pulses during the first few 
hours of sleep and after exercise. GH is one of the most abundant hormones 
secreted, influencing growth of cells, bones, muscles and organs throughout 
the body. Production of GH peaks at adolescence. Every three years approximately 90% of the cells in the human body are newly made. 
The body is composed of more than 100 trillion cells that are continuously 
dying and regenerating. The brain and the nervous system retain their original 
cells; however, in the brain new proteins are continuously being produced to 
store memories of every new experience. Overall intelligence and the ability 
to learn and memorize all depend on adequate growth hormone. Growth hormone replacement therapy is now available to reverse age-related symptoms, including wrinkling of the skin, increased body fat, decreased muscle mass, increased cholesterol, decreased stamina and energy, decreased mental function and loss of libido. 
When growth hormone falls below normal levels, supplementation offers the 
all-natural potential for great benefit. Growth hormone is an amazing substance 
which is safe and effective with no known side effects, if taken in the 
proper dosage amounts. GH is one of many endocrine hormones, such as estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, 
melatonin and DHEA, that all decline in production as we age. Hormones are tiny 
chemical messengers continuously secreted in the bloodstream in order to regulate 
the activities of the vital organs. The word ""hormone"" is derived from a Greek word 
meaning to stimulate. Many of these hormones can be replaced to deter some of the 
effects of aging; however, GH reaches far beyond the scope of these other 
hormones. Not only does it prevent biological aging, but it acts to greatly 
reverse a broad range of signs and symptoms associated with aging, including 
making the skin more elastic and causing wrinkles to disappear. GH also 
helps restore hair color and hair loss. 
 
THE ETERNAL FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH? Our bodies naturally produce GH in abundance when we are young, and its production 
gradually slows over time. The amount of GH after the age of 21 falls about 14% per 
decade, so that its production is reduced in half by age 60. While GH is not new, 
its availability as a supplement has been limited. Specialized clinics and physicians 
have been using GH for over 30 years on thousands of patients with consistent results. 
Unfortunately, due to the high costs previously associated with GH, only the medical 
profession and the wealthy have been privy to its benefits. Another problem has been 
that the large GH molecule, composed of 191 amino acids (protein), had been only 
effective administered through injections. However, a new technology developed by 
Anti-Aging Inc., now makes GH an effective, affordable and convenient alternative. 
 
GH production falls by 80% from age 21 to 61  
Growth hormone declines with age in every animal species that has been tested to date. 
The amount of decline in humans falls approximately 14% per decade. 
This results in the growth hormone production rate being reduced in half by the age 
of 60. Humans produce on a daily basis 500 micrograms per year at age 20, 
200 micrograms at age 40 and 25 micrograms at 80 years of age. Between the ages 
of 70 and 80, nearly everyone is deficient in growth hormone which results in SDS, 
or Somatotrophin Deficiency Syndrome. These symptoms are part of the disease called 
aging which the medical community has determined is not a normal occurrence. 
Healing ability and energy levels decrease, as does physical mobility. 
Those who want to maintain their youthful vitality and stamina should include 
an effective growth hormone therapy as part of their health regimen.
 After numerous clinical studies, the following was determined 
after 6 or more months of GH therapy:  _ Improved memory 
_ Regenerating of the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, spleen, kidneys and other organs 
_ Increased sexual drive and performance 
_ Increased fertility 
_ Enhanced immune system 
_ Quicker wound and fracture healing 
_ New hair growth and color reparation 
_ Sharper vision 
_ Improved exercise performance and tolerance 
_ Increased muscle mass without exercise 
_ Reduction of cellulite and fat 
_ Increased stamina and vitality 
_ Reduction in high blood pressure 
_ Improvement in sleep 
_ Anti-aging 
_ Wrinkle reduction and smoothing 
_ Decrease in LDL (bad) cholesterol 
_ Increase in HDL (good) cholesterol 
_ Strengthening of bones 
  IS GH SAFE? 
 
GH has been successfully used in the medical community 
for over thirty years and has been studies for over 60 years. 
Edmond Klein, M.D. and L. Cas Terry Ph.D., tested over 
800 individuals and reported in their 1995 study that 
GH had substantial benefits and no side effects.

QUESTIONS: From: moviebuff@cliffhanger.com 
Subject: Using pictures as links I'm changing my website and want to use pictures for the links to other pages. 
But, someone told me I should still put a 'click here' underneath all the 
pictures. To me, this removes all purpose of using the pictures.  How can I get across that you click on the pictures to get to other pages 
without coming right out and saying so? For example, I have a page with 
actor and actress information and just want to have a picture of my 
favorite stars to click on and change the picture every couple of days. Mark

Subject: Access using a proxy >From: CJ  (cj5000@post.com) 
>Subject: Unblocking sites so I can access? (Issue #422) --> I am currently living in a place where the ISP is 
blocking 50% of 
the web. I was told by someone that you can unblock these web sites by 
using a proxy, but I don't know what that means. I am wondering is 
there a way to get access to these sites? -- A proxy is easy to use if you use someone elses, they can be tricky to setup yourself. 
I have had very good results with Surfola. Basically you surf to their servers and then 
from there you surf Through/From their servers. I have several places I surf from that 
block content. Surfola easily bypasses them! Its also Free! You can also make money 
with them but I just use them to bypass anal retentive ISP/Corporate providers and 
because they allow me to surf anonymously! I have a detailed right-up on them at  http://linkpaks.com/paidtosurf/Surfola.php

http://www.anonymise.com and

Also note, that if your ISP is dictating to you which sites you may or

SITE REVIEWED:Comments on Site #123: http://netsbestinfo.homestead.com/nbi.html
Dennis 
damorganjr@yahoo.com
~~~~I reviewed site 123 and found the size of the font to be too aggressive and 
I don't like mustard yellow for a background. Also in the second or third 
paragraph is a misspelled word which should be ""first-come"" not as 
shown on the page.I feel a sample of the type of information offered in the newsletter should 
be displayed on the page as well as a sample of the free ads offered 
on the site. I will probably submit a free ad just to see the content of the newsletter.  As has been mentioned many times, some information about the person 
doing the page is always good.  We need some information about 
why this newsletter will be worthwhile to subscribe to. 
~~~~Dennis - I took a look at your site, and have recommendations 
for improving your page.
1- I use Internet Explorer and view web pages with my text size set to 
'smaller'. The text you used was quite large, like a font used for a heading 
for all the text. By making the text size smaller it wouldn't feel like 
you were screaming at me. Also, the background was just too much.
2- There were spelling errors in the text. Often it might be difficult for you 
to spot these yourself if you see the page all the time, but have a friend 
look it over. Spelling errors make the page look unprofessional.
3- Offer a sample of your newsletter so people can see what it looks like 
before they subscribe. Also, if you are asking for a person to give you 
their email address, you MUST have a privacy policy and let them know 
they can unsubscribe.
4- Think about adding a form for people to subscribe to the newsletter. 
It looks more professional than just offering an email address to send to.
5- Offer information about yourself, and the kinds of information your 
newsletter contains. Maybe extend your site to include back issues or 
an archive to see what information you have offered in the past.
6- Build another page for 'sponsoring info' and put prices on that 
page. Remove all pricing information from the home page.
~~~~I feel that the background is a little too bold and busy for the text. 
I also believe that the text is too large which makes it difficult to read 
quickly, and forces the reader to scroll down unnecessarily. 
I noticed some spelling errors, and I think that a link to the classifieds 
site should be provided, and online payments should be accepted. 
A site that sells advertising should have advertisments on it!
~~~~This is a very clear site with nothing interfering with the 
message.  I did not like the background colour, however that is 
personal, it did not detract from the information.  I was tempted 
to sign up for the newsletter but would have liked a link to see 
a current issue. There was an error in the wording (a word 
missed) which needs correction and I think the fonts could be 
smaller. Overall a non-confusing site which makes a nice change. *cheers*~~~~Could use a better background and the fonts are very large, there also 
are errors in the following paragraphs : 
""first com-first serve"" and ""to place a sponsor advertisement, 
send your to my email""
~~~~A single page site. It is necessary to subscribe to the webmaster's 
newsletter to see what he's doing, and it doesn't seem to me to be 
a way to get people to visit. I wouldn't, for example. He claims to 
have lots of tidbits of information that, he says, we probably 
didn't know, and this is possible, but in my opinion, he would be 
better served if he at least put some of the things out there for 
all to see - when the appetite, so to speak, if he want people to 
subscribe. As it is, I would not bother.
~~~~What does one expect from a site like netsbestinfo? Some useful 
resources and some useful tips and also some forms of easy 
advertisement on the net. But what we get here is a newsletter 
with the owner (whose email reads damorgarjr@yahoo.com) 
asking us to subscribe us to his newsletter for a free 4-line ad. 
He also tells of paid category of advertisements. This is all we get 
from a site which has a grand title. Even the information about 
the newsletter is hardly impressive and is presented in about 35-to-40 
points size which gets difficult to read. 
~~~~A neat enough site but the background could be a little hard on 
the eyes. There is only really one problem with this page - its 
just an advertisement for a newsletter. No, scratch that, its an 
advertisement to place free ads in a newsletter. A bold enough 
move perhaps but I learned hardly anything about the newsletter 
itself and immediately started worrying about getting a flood of 
ads to my email account so I didn't even subscribe. Presumably 
you'd want to get people to sign up so might I suggest splitting 
the page into the newsletter itself, perhaps a sample issue, 
a privacy policy and a promise not to drown in ads and then click 
for more info on your free ads.

>Subject: Unblocking sites so I can access? (Issue #422) CJ, Two such sites that allows proxy surfing are: 
http://www.anonymise.com and
http://www.anonymizer.com . However, if you cannot get to that site then obviously it will not work. 
Also note, that if your ISP is dictating to you which sites you may or

SITE REVIEWED:Comments on Site #123: http://netsbestinfo.homestead.com/nbi.html
Dennis 
damorganjr@yahoo.com
~~~~I reviewed site 123 and found the size of the font to be too aggressive and 
I don't like mustard yellow for a background. Also in the second or third 
paragraph is a misspelled word which should be ""first-come"" not as 
shown on the page.I feel a sample of the type of information offered in the newsletter should 
be displayed on the page as well as a sample of the free ads offered 
on the site. I will probably submit a free ad just to see the content of the newsletter.  As has been mentioned many times, some information about the person 
doing the page is always good.  We need some information about 
why this newsletter will be worthwhile to subscribe to. 
~~~~Dennis - I took a look at your site, and have recommendations 
for improving your page.
1- I use Internet Explorer and view web pages with my text size set to 
'smaller'. The text you used was quite large, like a font used for a heading 
for all the text. By making the text size smaller it wouldn't feel like 
you were screaming at me. Also, the background was just too much.
2- There were spelling errors in the text. Often it might be difficult for you 
to spot these yourself if you see the page all the time, but have a friend 
look it over. Spelling errors make the page look unprofessional.
3- Offer a sample of your newsletter so people can see what it looks like 
before they subscribe. Also, if you are asking for a person to give you 
their email address, you MUST have a privacy policy and let them know 
they can unsubscribe.
4- Think about adding a form for people to subscribe to the newsletter. 
It looks more professional than just offering an email address to send to.
5- Offer information about yourself, and the kinds of information your 
newsletter contains. Maybe extend your site to include back issues or 
an archive to see what information you have offered in the past.
6- Build another page for 'sponsoring info' and put prices on that 
page. Remove all pricing information from the home page.
~~~~I feel that the background is a little too bold and busy for the text. 
I also believe that the text is too large which makes it difficult to read 
quickly, and forces the reader to scroll down unnecessarily. 
I noticed some spelling errors, and I think that a link to the classifieds 
site should be provided, and online payments should be accepted. 
A site that sells advertising should have advertisments on it!
~~~~This is a very clear site with nothing interfering with the 
message.  I did not like the background colour, however that is 
personal, it did not detract from the information.  I was tempted 
to sign up for the newsletter but would have liked a link to see 
a current issue. There was an error in the wording (a word 
missed) which needs correction and I think the fonts could be 
smaller. Overall a non-confusing site which makes a nice change. *cheers*~~~~Could use a better background and the fonts are very large, there also 
are errors in the following paragraphs : 
""first com-first serve"" and ""to place a sponsor advertisement, 
send your to my email""
~~~~A single page site. It is necessary to subscribe to the webmaster's 
newsletter to see what he's doing, and it doesn't seem to me to be 
a way to get people to visit. I wouldn't, for example. He claims to 
have lots of tidbits of information that, he says, we probably 
didn't know, and this is possible, but in my opinion, he would be 
better served if he at least put some of the things out there for 
all to see - when the appetite, so to speak, if he want people to 
subscribe. As it is, I would not bother.
~~~~What does one expect from a site like netsbestinfo? Some useful 
resources and some useful tips and also some forms of easy 
advertisement on the net. But what we get here is a newsletter 
with the owner (whose email reads damorgarjr@yahoo.com) 
asking us to subscribe us to his newsletter for a free 4-line ad. 
He also tells of paid category of advertisements. This is all we get 
from a site which has a grand title. Even the information about 
the newsletter is hardly impressive and is presented in about 35-to-40 
points size which gets difficult to read. 
~~~~A neat enough site but the background could be a little hard on 
the eyes. There is only really one problem with this page - its 
just an advertisement for a newsletter. No, scratch that, its an 
advertisement to place free ads in a newsletter. A bold enough 
move perhaps but I learned hardly anything about the newsletter 
itself and immediately started worrying about getting a flood of 
ads to my email account so I didn't even subscribe. Presumably 
you'd want to get people to sign up so might I suggest splitting 
the page into the newsletter itself, perhaps a sample issue, 
a privacy policy and a promise not to drown in ads and then click 
for more info on your free ads.

32 Easy Ways To Breath New Life Into Any Webpage
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Â Â Â Â Â  It's true.
Ask the CEOs of Yahoo.com and America Online.Â  They'll
tell you it's true.Â  Send an email to Terry Dean or Allen
Says or Jim Daniels and ask them about it.Â  They'll agree
100% that it's true.Â  Don't just take my word for it.
In fact, you can contact any of the 10,000 folks online
selling web marketing resources, and they will all tell you
emphatically, without question, no doubts whatsoever, that
it is absolutely true.
It's true. ANYONE can earn a living online.Â  Really, they
can.Â  But, it takes several very important components to
join the 5% who are successful on the web.
Â Â Â Â  One of those necessities is a website.
Â Â Â Â  Now, your website does one of two things...
Â Â Â Â  ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't.
For 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do
not produce results.
And there is a very simple reason for poor performance.
Poor sales letters.
Does your website convince people to make a purchase?
If not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into
your sales letter...
1) Write your sales letter with an individual in mind.
Go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your
sales letter to.Â  Doesn't matter if it is grandma or your
next door neighbor or your cat.Â  Write your sales letter
just like you are writing it to them personally.Â  Why?
Because when your potential customer reads, it then it will
seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind.
Too often, sales letters are written as if they were going
to be read to an audience rather than one person.Â  Keep your
sales letters personal, because one person at a time is
going to read them.
2) Use an illustration to get your point across.Â  In my
sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on
the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must
constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our
businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily
making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback
across Montana on a grizzly bear.Â  Leads have read of how
getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively
marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home
a solid message.Â  Tell stories that illustrate a point you
are trying to make.Â  Emphasize a benefit by sharing an
account from the ""real world.""Â  It effectively creates
interest and further establishes the point.
3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first
line.Â  Your first line of the sales letter should
immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know
more.Â  Go back to the beginning of this article.Â  The first
words were, ""It's true.""Â  I can guarantee you that either
consciously or subconsciously you thought ""What's true?""
Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking
about.Â  Before you even knew it you were right here, 8
paragraphs into this article.Â  Carefully craft your first
line.Â  If you can immediately get them wanting to know more,
you've got a winner.
4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted
lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use
bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or
service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer.
Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight
each line and create a sense of more length to the list.
5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.Â  Shortly after
your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet
list of benefits to absorb.Â  Hit them with your best shot.
Pull out the big guns and stress ""just a few of"" the most
important things the reader will discover.Â  By offering a
killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically
create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad
copy.Â  After all, if they are already interested after the
first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to
finding out even more reasons why your product or service
will aid them.
6) Just let it all flow out.Â  Write down everything that
enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You
can edit it later.Â  If you just sit and start writing
everything you know about your product or service and how it
will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much
information floods your mind.Â  Write it ALL down.Â  Then read
through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to
many of the points.Â  Edit it after you have exhausted all
of your ideas.
7) Make your sales letter personal.Â  Make sure that the
words ""you"" and ""your"" are at least 4:1 over ""I"" and ""my.""
Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not
yourself.Â  I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes,
but it's something like this, ""I don't care a thing about
your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn.""Â  Leads aren't
interested in you or your products, they are interested in
themselves and their wants and needs.Â  When you are finished
with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test
webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see
what the ratio between ""you"" and ""your"" versus references to
""I,"" ""me,"" ""my,"" etc.Â  It's a free service.Â  Make sure it's
at least 4:1 in favor of the customer.
8) Write like you speak.Â  Forget all of those rules that
your grammar teacher taught you.Â  Write your sales letters
in everyday language, just like you would talk in person.
Don't be afraid to begin sentences with ""And"" or ""Because.""
Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition.
Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great
American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest
Hemingway.
9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each.
Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.Â  Use short
paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be
afraid to use short sentences.Â  Like this one.
Or this.
See what I mean?Â  Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of
the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often
force the reader to get distracted.
10)Â  Stress the benefits, not the features.Â  Again,
readers want the burning question answered, ""What's in it
forÂ  me?""Â  What need is it going to meet? What want is it
going to fill?Â  How is your product or service going to be
of value or benefit to the reader?Â  Spell it out.Â  Don't
focus on the features of your product or service , but
rather how those features will add value to the life of your
reader.
For example:Â  If you are selling automobile tires, you may
very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world,
but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I
do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while
we are traveling.Â  So, instead of focusing on your selection,
you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe
because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not
selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress
the benefits, not the features.
11) Keep the reader interested.Â  Some sales letters read
like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can
perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are
filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to
understand.Â  Unless you are writing to a very targeted
audience, avoid using technical language that many readers
might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language
and information that are easy to understand and follow.
12) Target your sales letter.Â  When you are finished with
your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a
specific audience.Â  For example: If you are selling a ""work
at home"" product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding
words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards
women who are homemakers.Â  Then, rewrite the same sales
letter and target it to college students.Â  Write another
letter targeting senior citizens.Â  Still another could be
written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income
during summer vacation.Â  The possibilities are endless.
All you need to do is add a few words here and there in
your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service
is specifically designed for a target audience. ""Work only
5 hours a week,"" would become ""College Students, work only
5 hours a week.""Â  Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload
all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website
(you could easily target 100's of groups).
Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted
mediums.Â  You could advertise the ""College Students"" page
in a campus ezine.Â  The ""Senior Citizens"" page could be
advertised at a retirement community message board.
By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally
open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product
to.Â  And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a
match made for them.
13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.Â  Use short sentences
and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention
grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One
thing that I have always found to work very well in sales
letters...
Â Â Â Â  ...is to use a pause like this.
Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting
to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also,
if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on
several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook
line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. ""Let's
get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK
HERE to continue.""
14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.Â  When the
customer purchases your product, they will generate ""a flood
of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark.""
If they do not order today, then they will ""feel like a cat
that let the mouse get away.""Â  Use words to create a picture
in the readers' mind.Â  When you think of Superman, what
comes to mind?Â  Immediately, we remember that he is ""faster
than a speeding bullet.""Â  ""More powerful than a locomotive.""
""Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound."" See how
word pictures stick in our minds?
15) Focus on one product or service.Â  Don't try to sell
your customer multiple products at the same time. It only
confuses the reader.Â  Keep your ad copy directed at one
specific product or service.Â  Then, use other products and
services as back-end products.
16) Make it stand out.Â  Don't kid yourself.Â  There are
hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the
same thing you are doing.Â  How will you stand out among the
crowd?Â  Your sales letter must inject personality. It must
breathe of originality.Â  Your product or service is
different. It's not like all of the rest.Â  It is unique.
Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the
competition.Â  It must create a feeling of ""You won't find
this anywhere else.""
17) Be believable. ""Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!""
Delete.Â  Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or
something?Â  Get real.Â  Don't make outrageous claims that
are obviously not the truth.Â  You'll ruin your reputation.
Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be
reversed.Â  Once you have been branded a liar, you will
NEVER be anything but a liar.Â  It doesn't matter if you
launch the most respectable, honest business available
anywhere, people will always have doubt because they
remember the crazy stuff you've said before.Â  Be believable.
Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth.
18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but
rather be EXACT.Â  Instead of ""over 100 tips for losing
weight"" use ""124 tips for losing weight."" By generalizing
information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's
mind.Â  ""What am I really getting here?Â  Does he even know?""
When you use specific information, the reader begins to
think, ""This person must have counted.Â  I know exactly what
I can expect.""Â  ""Platitudes and generalities roll off the
human understanding like water from a duck,"" wrote Claude
Hopkins in his classic book ""Scientific Advertising."" ""They
leave no impression whatsoever.""
19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would
want to know about your product or service.Â  Answer all of
their questions, anything they would want to consider before
making a purchase.Â  Think about it from their point of view.
Ask yourself, ""Why wouldn't I buy this?""Â  Then, address that
in your sales letter.Â  Remove anything that would keep the
reader from making the purchase.
20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.Â  Share actual
excerpts from what your current customers are saying about
your product or service. Many websites have an entire
section or even a separate page that has endorsements and
compliments listed.Â  Satisfied customers remove some of the
doubt in the mind of the reader.Â  ""If these people have
found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I
probably will too.""Â  Especially effective are testimonials
from respected, well known ""authorities"" within your target
field.
21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter.
A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your
ad copy.Â  Use them frequently -but don't overuse.Â  A well-
placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings
them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next
paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on
your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.Â  They are
that important.
22) Avoid asking stupid questions.Â  ""Wouldn't you like to
make $1,000,000 a year?"" ""Doesn't that sound great?"" ""Would
you like to be as successful as I am?""Â  Avoid any question
that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them
feel like they are inferior.
23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy.
If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a
purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try
to influence them to buy in the future.Â  By offering a free
item, you canÂ  request their email address in order to
obtain the freebie.Â  By doing this, you can now follow-up
with the customer for a potential future sale.
Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having
your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item.
And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful
product or service which impresses the customer, they
probably will be back as a customer soon.
24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.Â  One of the things
that I have found very effective in writing sales letters
is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product
I am offering.Â  Ginsu made this one famous. They were
selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial
was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table
it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality
bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages
the credibility of your main offer.
25) Use connective phrases like ""But wait, there's more""
and ""But that's not all.""Â  These phrases effectively lead
the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly
when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or
leads into bonus items.Â  Again, the idea is MORE and MORE
value and benefits to the reader.
26) Always include a deadline.Â  By including a deadline,
you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer.
""If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the
bonuses.""Â  ""Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining,
I've got to hurry.""Â  Let the customer know what they will
be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember,
they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will
miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines
are very effective.Â  Every sales letter should have one.
27) Tell them exactly how to order.Â  Be clear as to the
order process. Point them towards the order link.Â  Tell
them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks,
etc.)Â  Make this process as simple and clear as can be.
If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue.
28)Â  Explain when the product will be delivered.Â  How
quickly will the order be processed?Â  When will the order be
available?Â  Let the customer know exactly what they can
expect when they place their order.Â  The more specific you
can be here, the better.Â  Let them know that you have a
system in place.Â  ""Operators are standing by.""Â  Their order
will be handled properly.Â  Tell them.
29) Offer a money back guarantee.Â  Take away their last
reason to hold back.Â  Offer a ""no questions asked"" 30 day
guarantee.Â  Most people may not realize this, but in most
cases, it's the law of the land.Â  You are REQUIRED to give
them their money back if they are not satisfied with the
product or service.Â  Since it's the law anyway, why not make
it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your
product or service RISK-FREE.
30) Instruct them to respond immediately.Â  Many people
just need to read those words, ""Act Now!""Â  ""Order today!""
""Click Here to Instantly Place Your Order.""Â  You've got them
this far, now tell them what you want them to do.Â  Get them
to ""Act Fast!""Â  Have you ever heard a mail order commercial
on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right
way?
31) Include a post script.Â  People will always read the
P.S.Â  Always. In fact, the P.S. is one of the MOST IMPORTANT
parts of your sales letter. Why?Â  Because in many cases the
visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the
end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.Â  A
P.S. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they
see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed
description of what they will receive for their money. Use
your P.S. to restate your offer in detail.
32) Include a second post script.Â  You better believe
if they read the first P.S., they will read a P.P.S.Â  Use
this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer
another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would
make them want to order.Â  I guarantee you they will read it.
Use these 32 tips and I guarantee you that you will see
a significant increase in the amount of responses you
receive from your sales letters.Â  In fact, it would be
impossible for your responses to not improve.

 32 Easy Ways To Breath New Life Into Any WebpageÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â  It's true.
Ask the CEOs of Yahoo.com and America Online.Â  They'll
tell you it's true.Â  Send an email to Terry Dean or Allen
Says or Jim Daniels and ask them about it.Â  They'll agree
100% that it's true.Â  Don't just take my word for it.
In fact, you can contact any of the 10,000 folks online
selling web marketing resources, and they will all tell you
emphatically, without question, no doubts whatsoever, that
it is absolutely true.
It's true. ANYONE can earn a living online.Â  Really, they
can.Â  But, it takes several very important components to
join the 5% who are successful on the web.
Â Â Â Â  One of those necessities is a website.
Â Â Â Â  Now, your website does one of two things...
Â Â Â Â  ...it either makes the sale, or it doesn't.
For 95% of online businesses, their websites simply do
not produce results.
And there is a very simple reason for poor performance.
Poor sales letters.
Does your website convince people to make a purchase?
If not, here are 32 easy ways to breathe new life into
your sales letter...
1) Write your sales letter with an individual in mind.
Go ahead and pick out someone, a real person to write your
sales letter to.Â  Doesn't matter if it is grandma or your
next door neighbor or your cat.Â  Write your sales letter
just like you are writing it to them personally.Â  Why?
Because when your potential customer reads, it then it will
seem personal, almost like you wrote it with them in mind.
Too often, sales letters are written as if they were going
to be read to an audience rather than one person.Â  Keep your
sales letters personal, because one person at a time is
going to read them.
2) Use an illustration to get your point across.Â  In my
sales letters I have told stories about my car stalling on
the side of the road to illustrate the idea that we must
constantly add the fuel of advertising to keep our
businesses running. I have compared the hype of easily
making millions online to the chances of me riding bareback
across Montana on a grizzly bear.Â  Leads have read of how
getting to the top of an oak tree relates to aggressively
marketing online. People love a good story that pounds home
a solid message.Â  Tell stories that illustrate a point you
are trying to make.Â  Emphasize a benefit by sharing an
account from the ""real world.""Â  It effectively creates
interest and further establishes the point.
3) Create an interest in the reader from the very first
line.Â  Your first line of the sales letter should
immediately create a desire in the reader to want to know
more.Â  Go back to the beginning of this article.Â  The first
words were, ""It's true.""Â  I can guarantee you that either
consciously or subconsciously you thought ""What's true?""
Immediately, your mind wanted to know what I was talking
about.Â  Before you even knew it you were right here, 8
paragraphs into this article.Â  Carefully craft your first
line.Â  If you can immediately get them wanting to know more,
you've got a winner.
4) Use bullets. People spend a lot of time reading bulleted
lists. In fact, they often reread them over and over. Use
bulleted lists to stress the benefits of your product or
service, to spell out exactly what is included in your offer.
Use an extra space in between each bullet to really highlight
each line and create a sense of more length to the list.
5) Launch into a bullet list immediately.Â  Shortly after
your opening line, immediately give the reader a bullet
list of benefits to absorb.Â  Hit them with your best shot.
Pull out the big guns and stress ""just a few of"" the most
important things the reader will discover.Â  By offering a
killer list early in your sales letter, you will automatically
create a desire in the reader to continue through your ad
copy.Â  After all, if they are already interested after the
first list of benefits, they will certainly be open to
finding out even more reasons why your product or service
will aid them.
6) Just let it all flow out.Â  Write down everything that
enters your mind as you are writing your sales letter. You
can edit it later.Â  If you just sit and start writing
everything you know about your product or service and how it
will benefit your customer, you will be amazed at how much
information floods your mind.Â  Write it ALL down.Â  Then read
through it - you'll be able to add a lot more detail to
many of the points.Â  Edit it after you have exhausted all
of your ideas.
7) Make your sales letter personal.Â  Make sure that the
words ""you"" and ""your"" are at least 4:1 over ""I"" and ""my.""
Your ad copy must be written about YOUR CUSTOMER not
yourself.Â  I'm not sure how the old advertising adage goes,
but it's something like this, ""I don't care a thing about
your lawn mower, I just care about my lawn.""Â  Leads aren't
interested in you or your products, they are interested in
themselves and their wants and needs.Â  When you are finished
with your sales letter and have uploaded it to a test
webpage, run a check at http://www.keywordcount.com and see
what the ratio between ""you"" and ""your"" versus references to
""I,"" ""me,"" ""my,"" etc.Â  It's a free service.Â  Make sure it's
at least 4:1 in favor of the customer.
8) Write like you speak.Â  Forget all of those rules that
your grammar teacher taught you.Â  Write your sales letters
in everyday language, just like you would talk in person.
Don't be afraid to begin sentences with ""And"" or ""Because.""
Don't worry about ending a sentence with a preposition.
Write like you speak. Your sales letter isn't the great
American novel, so don't write it like you are Ernest
Hemingway.
9) Use short paragraphs consisting of 2-4 sentences each.
Long copy works... but long paragraphs do not.Â  Use short
paragraphs that lead into the next paragraph. Don't be
afraid to use short sentences.Â  Like this one.
Or this.
See what I mean?Â  Shorter paragraphs keep the interest of
the reader. Longer paragraphs cause eye strain and often
force the reader to get distracted.
10)Â  Stress the benefits, not the features.Â  Again,
readers want the burning question answered, ""What's in it
forÂ  me?""Â  What need is it going to meet? What want is it
going to fill?Â  How is your product or service going to be
of value or benefit to the reader?Â  Spell it out.Â  Don't
focus on the features of your product or service , but
rather how those features will add value to the life of your
reader.
For example:Â  If you are selling automobile tires, you may
very well have the largest assortment of tires in the world,
but who cares? I don't care about your selection. But, I
do care about keeping my 3-month-old baby girl safe while
we are traveling.Â  So, instead of focusing on your selection,
you focus on the fact that my baby girl can be kept safe
because you have a tire that will fit my car. You're not
selling tires, you're selling safety for my family. Stress
the benefits, not the features.
11) Keep the reader interested.Â  Some sales letters read
like they are a manual trying to explain to me how I can
perform some complicated surgery on my wife. They are
filled with words and phrases that I need a dictionary to
understand.Â  Unless you are writing to a very targeted
audience, avoid using technical language that many readers
might not understand. Keep it simple, using words, language
and information that are easy to understand and follow.
12) Target your sales letter.Â  When you are finished with
your final draft of the sales letter, target it to a
specific audience.Â  For example: If you are selling a ""work
at home"" product, then rewrite the sales letter by adding
words in the headlines and ad copy that are targeted towards
women who are homemakers.Â  Then, rewrite the same sales
letter and target it to college students.Â  Write another
letter targeting senior citizens.Â  Still another could be
written to high school teachers wanting to earn extra income
during summer vacation.Â  The possibilities are endless.
All you need to do is add a few words here and there in
your ad copy to make it appear that your product or service
is specifically designed for a target audience. ""Work only
5 hours a week,"" would become ""College Students, work only
5 hours a week.""Â  Your sales letter is now targeted. Upload
all of the sales letters to separate pages on your website
(you could easily target 100's of groups).
Then, simply advertise the targeted pages in targeted
mediums.Â  You could advertise the ""College Students"" page
in a campus ezine.Â  The ""Senior Citizens"" page could be
advertised at a retirement community message board.
By creating these targeted sales letters, you can literally
open up dozens of new groups to sell your existing product
to.Â  And, in their eyes, it looks like the product was a
match made for them.
13) Make your ad copy easy to follow.Â  Use short sentences
and paragraphs. Break up the sales letter with attention
grabbing headlines that lead into the next paragraph. One
thing that I have always found to work very well in sales
letters...
Â Â Â Â  ...is to use a pause like this.
Start the sentence on one line, leaving the reader wanting
to know more, and then finishing up on the next line. Also,
if you are going to use a sales letter that continues on
several different pages of your website, use a catchy hook
line at the end of each page to keep them clicking. ""Let's
get you started down the road to success, shall we? CLICK
HERE to continue.""
14) Use similes and metaphors for effect.Â  When the
customer purchases your product, they will generate ""a flood
of traffic that would make Noah start building another ark.""
If they do not order today, then they will ""feel like a cat
that let the mouse get away.""Â  Use words to create a picture
in the readers' mind.Â  When you think of Superman, what
comes to mind?Â  Immediately, we remember that he is ""faster
than a speeding bullet.""Â  ""More powerful than a locomotive.""
""Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound."" See how
word pictures stick in our minds?
15) Focus on one product or service.Â  Don't try to sell
your customer multiple products at the same time. It only
confuses the reader.Â  Keep your ad copy directed at one
specific product or service.Â  Then, use other products and
services as back-end products.
16) Make it stand out.Â  Don't kid yourself.Â  There are
hundreds, maybe thousands out there on the web doing the
same thing you are doing.Â  How will you stand out among the
crowd?Â  Your sales letter must inject personality. It must
breathe of originality.Â  Your product or service is
different. It's not like all of the rest.Â  It is unique.
Right? Your sales letter must separate you from the
competition.Â  It must create a feeling of ""You won't find
this anywhere else.""
17) Be believable. ""Earn $54,000 in the next 24 hours!!!""
Delete.Â  Good grief, do they think I am an idiot or
something?Â  Get real.Â  Don't make outrageous claims that
are obviously not the truth.Â  You'll ruin your reputation.
Let me tell you a simple universal fact that cannot be
reversed.Â  Once you have been branded a liar, you will
NEVER be anything but a liar.Â  It doesn't matter if you
launch the most respectable, honest business available
anywhere, people will always have doubt because they
remember the crazy stuff you've said before.Â  Be believable.
Don't exaggerate, mislead, stretch or distort the truth.
18) Be specific. Don't generalize your information, but
rather be EXACT.Â  Instead of ""over 100 tips for losing
weight"" use ""124 tips for losing weight."" By generalizing
information, it creates doubt and questions in the reader's
mind.Â  ""What am I really getting here?Â  Does he even know?""
When you use specific information, the reader begins to
think, ""This person must have counted.Â  I know exactly what
I can expect.""Â  ""Platitudes and generalities roll off the
human understanding like water from a duck,"" wrote Claude
Hopkins in his classic book ""Scientific Advertising."" ""They
leave no impression whatsoever.""
19) Be complete. Tell the reader everything they would
want to know about your product or service.Â  Answer all of
their questions, anything they would want to consider before
making a purchase.Â  Think about it from their point of view.
Ask yourself, ""Why wouldn't I buy this?""Â  Then, address that
in your sales letter.Â  Remove anything that would keep the
reader from making the purchase.
20) Use testimonials to boost your sales.Â  Share actual
excerpts from what your current customers are saying about
your product or service. Many websites have an entire
section or even a separate page that has endorsements and
compliments listed.Â  Satisfied customers remove some of the
doubt in the mind of the reader.Â  ""If these people have
found a lot of value and benefit in the product, then I
probably will too.""Â  Especially effective are testimonials
from respected, well known ""authorities"" within your target
field.
21) Use headlines over and over throughout the sales letter.
A headline isn't just relegated to the beginning of your
ad copy.Â  Use them frequently -but don't overuse.Â  A well-
placed headline re-grabs the reader's attention, brings
them deeper into the letter, and readies them for the next
paragraph. You will want to spend as much time working on
your headlines as you do the entire sales letter.Â  They are
that important.
22) Avoid asking stupid questions.Â  ""Wouldn't you like to
make $1,000,000 a year?"" ""Doesn't that sound great?"" ""Would
you like to be as successful as I am?""Â  Avoid any question
that insults the intelligence of your reader or makes them
feel like they are inferior.
23) Offer a freebie even if the customer doesn't buy.
If the customer decides he or she isn't going to make a
purchase, then you want to follow-up with them later to try
to influence them to buy in the future.Â  By offering a free
item, you canÂ  request their email address in order to
obtain the freebie.Â  By doing this, you can now follow-up
with the customer for a potential future sale.
Additionally, you can continue the sales process by having
your ad copy, banners, flyers, etc. within the free item.
And, of course, if your free item is a high quality, useful
product or service which impresses the customer, they
probably will be back as a customer soon.
24) Use bonuses to overwhelm the reader.Â  One of the things
that I have found very effective in writing sales letters
is to include bonus items that OUT-VALUE the actual product
I am offering.Â  Ginsu made this one famous. They were
selling a set of steak knives, but before the commercial
was finished, you had so many bonus items on the table
it was hard to refuse. Make sure you provide quality
bonuses and not some worthless, outdated junk that damages
the credibility of your main offer.
25) Use connective phrases like ""But wait, there's more""
and ""But that's not all.""Â  These phrases effectively lead
the reader from one paragraph to the next, particularly
when the next paragraph is a bullet list of benefits, or
leads into bonus items.Â  Again, the idea is MORE and MORE
value and benefits to the reader.
26) Always include a deadline.Â  By including a deadline,
you create a sense of urgency in the mind of the customer.
""If I don't order within 24 hours, then I won't get the
bonuses.""Â  ""Oh no, there are only 10 items remaining,
I've got to hurry.""Â  Let the customer know what they will
be missing out on if they don't make the deadline. Remember,
they won't miss out on your products or bonuses, they will
miss out on all of the benefits of your products. Deadlines
are very effective.Â  Every sales letter should have one.
27) Tell them exactly how to order.Â  Be clear as to the
order process. Point them towards the order link.Â  Tell
them what methods you offer. (I.E. credit cards, checks,
etc.)Â  Make this process as simple and clear as can be.
If it takes more than 2 steps, most people won't continue.
28)Â  Explain when the product will be delivered.Â  How
quickly will the order be processed?Â  When will the order be
available?Â  Let the customer know exactly what they can
expect when they place their order.Â  The more specific you
can be here, the better.Â  Let them know that you have a
system in place.Â  ""Operators are standing by.""Â  Their order
will be handled properly.Â  Tell them.
29) Offer a money back guarantee.Â  Take away their last
reason to hold back.Â  Offer a ""no questions asked"" 30 day
guarantee.Â  Most people may not realize this, but in most
cases, it's the law of the land.Â  You are REQUIRED to give
them their money back if they are not satisfied with the
product or service.Â  Since it's the law anyway, why not make
it a benefit. Let them know that they are purchasing your
product or service RISK-FREE.
30) Instruct them to respond immediately.Â  Many people
just need to read those words, ""Act Now!""Â  ""Order today!""
""Click Here to Instantly Place Your Order.""Â  You've got them
this far, now tell them what you want them to do.Â  Get them
to ""Act Fast!""Â  Have you ever heard a mail order commercial
on television that didn't prompt the viewer to order right
way?
31) Include a post script.Â  People will always read the
P.S.Â  Always. In fact, the P.S. is one of the MOST IMPORTANT
parts of your sales letter. Why?Â  Because in many cases the
visitor at your website will scroll immediately down to the
end of your page to see how much it is going to cost.Â  A
P.S. is a perfect place to recap your offer, so when they
see your price tag, they will also see a very detailed
description of what they will receive for their money. Use
your P.S. to restate your offer in detail.
32) Include a second post script.Â  You better believe
if they read the first P.S., they will read a P.P.S.Â  Use
this post script to remind them of the deadline or offer
another bonus or point out some compelling factor that would
make them want to order.Â  I guarantee you they will read it.
Use these 32 tips and I guarantee you that you will see
a significant increase in the amount of responses you
receive from your sales letters.Â  In fact, it would be
impossible for your responses to not improve.

HOME-MAILERS NEEDED!
  
$300-$1000 PLUS WEEKLYSimple, pleasant work...you do at home.
  
  
Dear Friend,
  
Are you seeking a rewarding second income? Would you like to set your
own work schedule? Work the hours you choose? Earn extra income for
your family? If so, then we may have the answer. Current statistics show
that by the year 2010, 40-60% of the American work-force will be working
from home. Get a jump on your future and secure a job through us. Our
company provides a service to thousands of people and businesses across
the United States. With your help, we can reach and provide a better
service to more of these people and businesses, faster and at a lower cost
than our competitors. We handle a marketing program called the
Home-Mailers Program, which consists of envelope processing and mailing.
These positions require no special skills or experience, just a sincere desire
to GET STARTED, and EARN MONEY!
  
  YOU CAN EARN GOOD MONEY!!!
  
   Potential incomes range from $300 to $1000 weekly or more. Pay rate is
based on a $2.00 per envelope basis. The average Home-Mailer
stuffs anywhere from 150 to 500 envelopes a week, depending on the
amount of free time they have available. The envelopes you process will
make you a substantial income. You'll find this work, done easily and
quickly, can double or even triple your income. With just one or two hours
per day you will be excitedly surprised at how easy we've made it and how
profitable this work actually is. You can earn enough money working in
your spare time to purchase that new car or boat you've been wanting,
pay off credit cards, bills, or even take a vacation. Maybe just add more
financial security for yourself or your family. Whatever the reason, you can't
go wrong.
  
  ALL BUSINESS CAN BE DONE RIGHT FROM YOUR OWN HOME
  
  You can start the same day you receive our materials and begin receiving
money within a matter of days. These positions require no prior experience
or special skills. Under contract you will receive everything you need to
get you up and running as fast as possible. Paychecks are mailed out every
two weeks on the 1st and 16th of the month.
  
  HELP SOLVE YOUR MONEY PROBLEMS
  
   If you are looking for an excellent extra income to relieve financial
pressures, you owe it to yourself to investigate this program. Naturally, no
company can afford to send out costly materials to everyone who writes in
asking for it. Therefore, we must ask each applicant for a one time
application processing fee of $27.00. This fee covers processing and
materials you will receive upon your acceptance and is returned to you
with your first paycheck. It also assures us that you are serious about
working with our company as a Home-Mailer. We will not ask or require
you to pay us for any additional information, instructions, or materials to
stay with us, and stay with us as long as you desire. If for any reason you
are not accepted into the Home-Mailers Program, your processing fee will
be sent directly back to you. There is no hassle. However, you must act
promptly. At this time we are in need of dependable Home-Mailers in your
area, of whom may start in the very near future. There are only a limited
number of positions needed for each region of the country and as soon as
we have enough people to complete the mailing needs in your area we
will not be offering any more applications. We need your help now! So if
you're a productive, positive person we're looking forward to working with
you.
  
  SIMPLE, EASY, AND PROFITABLE, THIS PROGRAM IS THE BEST
  WAY TO MAKE AN EXCELLENT INCOME AT HOME.
  
  If this sounds like something you might be interested in, read on. If not,
thank you for your time. We hope to hear from you soon.
  
  
Sincerely Yours,Ron M. Jenkins
Home-Mailing Division Manager

  Because we are a company recruiting people from the public we must
assure you that we are the BEST company to work with and that we provide
the MOST PROFITABLE income. Because we require an initial fee to get
started, many people are skeptical, and miss out on a great opportunity.
This fee covers our expenses for materials, postage, handling, and the time
it takes us to get you started. It also assures us that you are serious about
working with the Home-Mailers Program. We know that current Home-
Mailers are happy and making an excellent income just from reading their
testimonials. This makes us happy and enables us to succeed and continue
our success together. Here are just a couple of the many testimonials
received from Home-Mailers:
  
  I want to thank you for giving me this opportunity
  to work for your company. It couldn't have come along
  at a better time. The work is so simple and the pay is
  incredible. My wife and I have been stuffing envelopes
  together part-time and are exceeding what either of us
  make at our full-time jobs. Thanks again!
     J. Thomas ------ Miami, FL
  
  Thank you for everything! I was having trouble
  making ends meet at my present employment. But
  thanks to you and your Home-Mailers Program, I was
  able to pay off some old bills and put money in the
  bank. Now I'm looking forward to taking a well
  deserved vacation.
     M. Daniels ----- Seattle, WA
  
Why do we need Home-Mailers? The cost of supplying an office is more
expensive than most people may think. The cost of office space per square
foot, + taxes employing mailing staff, + taxes employing supervisors, +
taxes, medical insurance, dental insurance, and office liability insurance,
multiplied by each region we cover, all involving paperwork, accountants
and more taxes. WE NEED YOUR SERVICES TO SAVE TIME AND MONEY!
Your role in our company is as an Independent Commission Mailer, not an
employee. We will not take taxes from your paychecks and we cannot offer
medical or dental insurance. As a Home-Mailer, your residence and many
other aspects of everyday living may be able to be declared business
expenses. Receive cash-back on your taxes! You may request copies of
personal materials at any time at no charge to yourself. All business can 
be done by mail, from your own home. You can start the same day you
receive our materials and begin receiving money within days and have a
steady income as long as you desire. These positions require no prior
experience or special skills. There are many distribution companies who
want to expand their businesses, but do not want to pay the higher 
expenses. It is much easier to have independent Home-Mailers earn 
money doing this work themselves. This program is designed to help 
people cash in with a company who needs Home-Mailers. The Home-Mailers
Program has been perfected so that it has become one of the most 
successful and profitable programs ever and is supplying people around the
world with excellent primary and secondary incomes. We invite you to take
part in our success. The money you earn is up to you. We do not require 
that you mail a certain number of envelopes each week. You can take on
whatever amount of business that fits your schedule and you can stop
whenever you want, there are no obligations. There is no need to do any
door to door selling or phone soliciting. You may work in the comfort of your
own home, choose your own hours, set your own pace. No need to leave
your present job. Form workshops with your friends or get the whole family 
to join in. The possibilities are UNLIMITED!
  
  DUE TO COMPANY EXPANSION
  YOUR SERVICES ARE NEEDED NOW.
  Thank you, and we're looking forward to working
  with you, together in the future.

Internet Success Through Simplicity
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Every day of the week, I get questions from people all  
 over the world, including my No BS GIMG Members,  
 wanting to know some of the most valuable ""secrets"" 
 to my on-going internet success.
 
Let me say, above all else, I don't believe there are any 
 *true* ""secrets"" to success on the Net. What you do to 
 become successful in the online world is not a ""secret"", 
 in my opinion. Most successful people follow simple, clear, 
 repeatedly-proven strategies to succeed, whether on the 
 Net or off.
 
But, when it comes to someone asking for advice, 
 consultation, or simply asking, ""What's your secret?"", 
 I have to blush & say ...
 
Persistence and personality.
 
Of course, I always follow the advice with my own little 
 disclaimer: What makes ME successful may not work the 
 same for YOU ... & your first lesson is to get over 
 the deep-seeded idea that success - of any kind, in  
 my opinion - is somehow an unknown, unattainable secret.
 
Clearly, it is not. It's not unknown. It's not unattainable. 
 It's not years of digging to find the ""secrets"" to internet riches.
 
One thing that ""gets to me"" so often in my work as an 
 Internet Consultant, author and Internet Success 
 Strategist is that so many people on the Net seem to 
 have this incredibly huge mental block that stands 
 between themselves and success on the Net. It's 
 almost as if they've been barraged by so many claims 
 of what works and what doesn't work, and so many 
 LONG, complicated routes to actually succeeding in 
 their online venture, that ""success"" is the  equivelant of a 100-foot high brick wall.
 
It's NOT that difficult, my friends! It is NOT that complicated!!
 
Long-time friend and business associate Rick Beneteau 
 has a new eBook out called Branding YOU & Breaking 
the Bank. Get it!! 
 http://www.roibot.com/bybb.cgi?IM7517_bybtb . 
 But, the reason I mention this is the fact that he talks 
 so dynamically about the true simplicity of making your 
 online venture a success. 
 
And, yes, Rick & I come from the same school of 
 ""self marketing"" - marketing YOU! Obviously, that's 
 the core of his excellent new ebook, and I couldn't 
 agree with him more.
 
Point being, *you* ARE everything you do online to 
 succeed. You ARE your web site, your business, your 
 marketing piece, your customer service, your customers' 
 experiences with your business -- ALL of it, is YOU! 
 Read his ebook & you'll see more of what I'm saying.
 
The matter at hand is that brick wall you might have 
 standing high as you can see, blocking the path 
 between you & internet success. Listen to me - it is 
 not real OK? It doesn't exist. There's nothing there 
 to fear to begin with ... get over it!!
 
What I'm telling you is, the only thing standing between 
 you and the success you most desire ... is yourself. 
 When you realize this, you will tear down that brick 
 wall by means of complete and instantaneous 
 disintegration. It will no longer exist *in your mind*, 
 which is the only ""real"" place it ever was anyhow!
 
Yes, ""persistence and personality"" inherently includes 
 honesty, integrity, accountability, and many other 
 qualities but you also have to hone in on your ultimate 
 goals and realize that probably the most valuable,  
 powerful key to your success ... is YOU!
 
That may be the most incredible ""secret"" we ever 
 uncover in our lifetime! And, trust me, that brick wall 
 won't ever get in your way again ... unless you let it.
 
Talk about SIMPLE!!

Our web site is initially designed to get leads, build 
branding, and provide information.......with a 12 month goal 
of selling our service more specifically via a shopping cart. 
We offer a service and at this time take deposits and payments 
via our site.
Our site has been up less than 2 months and our expectation 
was that we would refer to our site for leads developed in 
traditional media and by referral for more information, and 
to make a professional impression on someone you may not 
meet before providing service.
The growth of our customer base shopping on line has grown 
outside of anyone's expectations.......certainly mine and 
I've been in this business for 25 years. The Internet is not 
dead in the horse business, it is just getting it's legs, and 
the folks using it want to get all the ancillary services 
on-line as well. Our site (the first we've developed) has 
exceeded our expectations, and we aren't satisfied with it 
yet.......we just wanted to get it there for information!

Branding. While quality customer service and product 
have been and will always be our top priority brand building 
Zesto is our most challenging task.
Zesto.com ranks very high and most often #1 or 2 on 
all major search engines and directories even Yahoo entering 
the keyword zesto. The problem is simply that,who if anyone 
would type the keyword zesto, therefore we must try to 
build our brand by ensuring that generic keywords associated with our products (citrus peel) are used throughout 
our site as well as search engine submissions.
Fortunately owning a non generic domain short, easy 
to remember and trademarked works in our favor because 
the marketability potential is limitless.

Zesto is our most challenging task.
Zesto.com ranks very high and most often #1 or 2 on 
all major search engines and directories even Yahoo entering 
the keyword zesto. The problem is simply that,who if anyone 
would type the keyword zesto, therefore we must try to 
build our brand by ensuring that generic keywords associated with our products (citrus peel) are used throughout 
our site as well as search engine submissions.
Fortunately owning a non generic domain short, easy 
to remember and trademarked works in our favor because 
the marketability potential is limitless.

579,"Snoring problems? Let Snore
Eliminator's all natural ingredients help you
sleep!Â Â Â Â Â Â  1r
Is snoring
keeping you up all night? No
more sleepless nights with
Snore Eliminator!!
Let your family sleep again by using the Snore Eliminator!
Do you know someone with a snoring problem? Snore Eliminator will help them
and they will love you for it.
Improve your sexual performance by reducing snoring and thus increasing
oxygen to your body!!People who snore have a higher risk of developing heart attacks, high blood
pressure, or strokes!! Snoring
also causes sleep disturbances that lead to increased anxiety,
hyperirritability, and decreased memory!
Individuals who snore have a 90% chance of daytime fatigue. Nine out of every
ten victims are male!How the Snore Eliminator will help you!What Causes Snoring?Over-relaxed throat and tongue muscles due to poor throat muscle
Excessive fat on the throat
Accumulation of secretion in the back of the throat and
Throat swelling from allergies and food
Heavy snoring is often associated with apnea, or the stopping
of breathing, during sleep. As
an individuals sleeps his or her sleeping pattern is disrupted and fragmented
due to snoring, thus they are never well rested. This can be a very hazardous
problem if someone is not getting proper REM sleep. Snoring is the audible
symptom of a blocked airway during sleep.The noise is caused by a vibration in the soft palate as the lungs pull hard
to take in a weakened current of incoming air. This blockage may result
from any number of circumstances, and these offer clues to get rid of the
problem.
Snoring is also more than likely to occur among people who sleep on their
backs; the tongue falls back toward the throat and partly closes the airway.The hidden dangers of snoring?
Snoring could increase the chances of a heart attack if not treated
Hypertension and increased anxiety are associated with snoring
Snoring causes sleep apnea a serious treatable medical conditionSnoring decreases sexual performance
by half, due to lack of oxygen
to the brain which decreases sexual responsiveness.
Most people who snore have a shortage
of oxygen for a
significant portion of that person's life. In recent studies, daytime fatigue
and cardiovascular disorder are related to snoring. In a few cases, heavy
snoring is a sign of potentially life -threatening problem. Sleep apnea in which
breathing stops for a second or even minutes at a time and finally resumes with
snorting and tossing around. This pattern may be repeated hundreds of times all
night long. The result is chronic oxygen shortage, which leads to abnormal heart
rhythms, high blood pressure, and heart strain.How the Snore Eliminator works!Snore Eliminator offers a unique break through with its all natural
enzymes which metabolize the
secretions, allowing the body to absorb them into the back of the throat. The
herbs reduce tissue swelling. The result is to open the airway and smooth the
airflow. This in turn eliminates the snoring for hours at a time. It also
reduces the noise made by
breathing through the mouth while sleeping.
By simply spraying the back of the throat, tongue and uvula with our special
formula, manufactured using our patented break through process, the soft tissue
is coated. This allows the throat
a chance to relax thus a
reduced amount of snoring. In most cases snoring is eliminated. Snore Eliminator
coats the throat area with a unique patented process of all natural lubricants.TESTIMONIALS from several of our satisfied customers:Lorenzo writes...
I am having a good nights sleep, finally. I used to wake myself up during the
night which was a real bummer as I would not always go back to sleep. Sleeping
through the night is great. Thanks a lot Snore Eliminator.
PS: My girlfriend loves it as much or more than I do.
Alex writes...
My husband uses it for another reason. He has a problem with blocked nasal
passages. While he's asleep the passages close, he stops breathing and he wakes
up gasping. When he takes Snore Eliminator his nose stays clearer and he's able
to sleep more restfully.
Thank you for a product that has really helped us!
Glen writes...
In February 1995, I was diagnosed with severe sleep apnea. A CPAP was the
suggested treatment for my affliction, but it did not help my condition. I heard
your advertisement and ordered a bottle of Snore Eliminator and my sleep
improved immediately. I continue to use it and my sleep has been better than it
had been in years. Thanks.

5 Ways to Create a Unique Website
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Internet users have no doubt seen several websites of identical
design. This is often because webmasters do not have the
ability or time to design and create unique websites. These
five points will help you come up with a one-of-a-kind design
for your website.1. Navigation SystemDeciding on a navigation system should be one of the first
things to consider when designing your website. Visitors
usually look for a way to get to the information they want
before reading anything else. I would suggest putting your
navigation system in two areas. Look at WebmasterBase 
(http://www.webmasterbase.com) for example. There is a list 
of categories on the left, and information about the network 
on the top bar.It is not recommended that you place your navigation at the
bottom of the page because:- People see the top of the page first
- If you have a lot of content on one page, the navigation gets
   pushed to bottom of the page... away from the visitor.2. Color SchemeWhen you are choosing colors, make sure they contrast. For
example, do not use bright green and florescent pink. Some
colors that are often used are white on black or black on
white.A wonderful utility that is web-based and free is Color Schemer
(http://www.godigitalstudios.com/www/color/), created by Aaron
Epstein. Many other programs exist that can assist you in
choosing colors. Try doing a search on FreewareFiles 
(http://www.freewarefiles.com), Tucows (http://www.tucows.com),
or Download.com (http://www.download.com) for ""color schemer.""3. Content WindowThis is the brain of the website. Make sure that the text here
is easy to read and understand.Also, provide your own original content. People do not want to
hear what somebody else has to say. They want to hear what 
you want to say! While it might be time consuming to write
your own content, it sure is worth it.To find content for your website, try searching at
EzineArticles (http://www.ezinearticles.com). Other people may
have used the articles, but if you become good friends with the
authors, they may send you new content as they write it. Be
careful though. Do not use too much content from other 
authors, as mentioned above.4. Font(s)Several types of fonts exist. The first one I will discuss is
fixed width or monospace, similar to Courier or Courier New.
Fixed width fonts are good for displaying code (like HTML.)Another type of font is called sans serif. It is similar to
Arial (Windows) or Helvetica (Macintosh). This font can be 
used for long pieces of text.The final type of font is called serif because it has serifs,
or curves, in each letter. Often, this font is called Times
(Windows) or Georgia (Macintosh). This font, like sans serif,
is often used for long blocks of text. It is preferred because
its rounded edges lead the reader to the next letter, making it
easier to read.5. AdvertisingAh, everybody's favorite... advertising! This is one of thing 
that almost every website has. The most common type is what 
is known as ""banner"" advertising. It is called that because it is 
long and thin (like a paper banner.) How long you ask? The 
generic kind is 468 pixels wide by 60 pixels high.New sizes however are being used. Take for example the new
style called ""skyscraper"" -- so called for a reason: it looks
like a skyscraper. It is tall (about 425 pixels) but not too
wide (about 100-125 pixels.)Finding a way to place advertising can be tricky. Banners 
used to be placed (and still are) only at the top of the page.
Nevertheless, banners are starting to be placed in the middle
of the page, at the bottom, or along the side.    ConclusionThese are only five things to consider when designing a
website. There are many others however. Let me know what

 5 Ways to Create a Unique Websiteï¿½ï¿½Internet users have no doubt seen several websites of
identical design. This is often because webmasters do not
have the ability or time to design and create unique websites.
These five points will help you come up with a one-of-a-kind
design for your website.
1. Navigation System
Deciding on a navigation system should be one of the first
things to consider when designing your website. Visitors
usually look for a way to get to the information they want
before reading anything else. I would suggest putting your
navigation system in two areas. Look at WebmasterBase
(http://www.webmasterbase.com)
for example. There is a list
of categories on the left, and information about the network
on the top bar.
It is not recommended that you place your navigation at the
bottom of the page because:
- People see the top of the page first
- If you have a lot of content on one page, the navigation
Â Â Â  gets pushed to bottom of the page... away from the
visitor.
2. Color Scheme
When you are choosing colors, make sure they contrast.
For example, do not use bright green and florescent pink.
Some colors that are often used are white on black or black
on white.
A wonderful utility that is web-based and free is Color
Schemer (http://www.godigitalstudios.com/www/color/),
created by Aaron Epstein. Many other programs exist that
can assist you in choosing colors. Try doing a search on
FreewareFiles (http://www.freewarefiles.com),
Tucows
(http://www.tucows.com), or Download.com
(http://www.download.com) for
""color schemer.""
3. Content Window
This is the brain of the website. Make sure that the text
here is easy to read and understand.
Also, provide your own original content. People do not want
to hear what somebody else has to say. They want to hear
what you want to say! While it might be time consuming to
write your own content, it sure is worth it.
To find content for your website, try searching at
EzineArticles (http://www.ezinearticles.com).
Other people
may have used the articles, but if you become good friends
with the authors, they may send you new content as they
write it. Be careful though. Do not use too much content
from other authors, as mentioned above.
4. Font(s)
Several types of fonts exist. The first one I will discuss is
fixed width or monospace, similar to Courier or Courier New.
Fixed width fonts are good for displaying code (like HTML.)
Another type of font is called sans serif. It is similar to
Arial (Windows) or Helvetica (Macintosh). This font can
be used for long pieces of text.
The final type of font is called serif because it has serifs,
or curves, in each letter. Often, this font is called Times
(Windows) or Georgia (Macintosh). This font, like sans serif,
is often used for long blocks of text. It is preferred because
its rounded edges lead the reader to the next letter, making
it easier to read.
5. Advertising
Ah, everybody's favorite... advertising! This is one of thing
that almost every website has. The most common type is
what is known as ""banner"" advertising. It is called that
because it is long and thin (like a paper banner.) How long
you ask? The generic kind is 468 pixels wide by 60 pixels high.
New sizes however are being used. Take for example the
new style called ""skyscraper"" -- so called for a reason: it
looks like a skyscraper. It is tall (about 425 pixels) but not
too wide (about 100-125 pixels.)
Finding a way to place advertising can be tricky. Banners
used to be placed (and still are) only at the top of the
page.Â  Nevertheless, banners are starting to be placed in
the middle of the page, at the bottom, or along the side.
Conclusion
These are only five things to consider when designing a
website. There are many others however. Let me know
what you find that helps you create a unique website. My

how my life will be when I have achieved them. FEEL it. 
EXPERIENCE it in as much sensory detail as I can possibly 
imagine.3. Take some action steps toward each of the three goals.4. Exercise my body and monitor carefully what I eat and

no    19%Comments:
~~~~~~~~~No. This is a funny thing to me.  I hear about so many 
people being super scared to give out their SS#.  Well folks, 
I can get your SS# for 50 cents.  Give me a name and address 
and about 90% of the time I can get the number.  We are so worried about putting our credit card number on
the net, but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and 
they take it out of our sight for 10 minutes.  They could do 
who knows what with the CC number.  I once had a person 
tell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy 
of her check to anyone (checks by fax) because then that 
person (me) would have her account info and could write 
a check out for thousands of dollars.  I told her to just send 
it to me then and she said that was OK.  Then I asked her 
to tell me what the difference was between the original check 
and a fax copy.  I told her to ask her lawyer that too.  Never 
heard back from her.  The bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info, it is 
available in many places.  Have a good day.
--  Terry    http://mysiteinc.com/tfn/lfi.html
~~~~~~~~~Yes. I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However, 
we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most 
importantly, never give any personal information at a site 
that is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar 
or a Veri secure sign or others. Also, never leave your information stored at a site. I put 
in my credit information in each time instead of having 
an account in standing, a little more time but less risks 
involved! Of course, I mostly shop at my own Internet 
mall and I know how safe it is there, credit card info is 
deleted in a matter of seconds. Overall, I believe the web 
to be a safe and very fruitful new frontier!
--  Catherine F.      http://www.catco.nexgenmall.com 
~~~~~~~~~Yes. I had phenomena for 6 weeks and did not realize that 
my ISP was shut down at the same time because the owner 
was in a bad car accident.  I had a full service account.  
My Internic fees were not paid so my WEB Address 
went unprotected.  A Russian stepped in; paid the fees; 
and, promptly assigned my www.SchoolOfGeomatics.com 
address to a porn shop.  Thus, I lost 4 years of building 
up 1st place rankings on 12 Search Engines and 2nd place 
on 8 more.  This set me back about 4  months: I believe I 
lost a minimum of $50,000.  
 
I have also been hit with viruses about 10 times.  The first 
time I lost almost 4 months of work.  Now, I back up often 
enough to not to lose so much time.  This is also Internet 
theft.  These people are nothing but out and out criminals 
and should spend years behind bars.
 
Customers are well protected from credit card theft; 
however, merchants can lose a lot of money.  I sell only by 
purchase order and certified or registered company checks.

Last Weeks's Survey Results & CommentsÂ  (07/27/01)

No. This is a funny thing to me.Â  I hear about so many
people being super scared to give out their SS#.Â  Well folks,
I can get your SS# for 50 cents.Â  Give me a name and address
and about 90% of the time I can get the number.
We are so worried about putting our credit card number on
the net, but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and
they take it out of our sight for 10 minutes.Â  They could do
who knows what with the CC number.Â  I once had a person
tell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy
of her check to anyone (checks by fax) because then that
person (me) would have her account info and could write
a check out for thousands of dollars.Â  I told her to just send
it to me then and she said that was OK.Â  Then I asked her
to tell me what the difference was between the original check
and a fax copy.Â  I told her to ask her lawyer that too.Â 
Never
heard back from her.
The bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info, it is
available in many places.Â  Have a good day.

Yes. I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However,
we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most
importantly, never give any personal information at a site
that is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar
or a Veri secure sign or others.
Also, never leave your information stored at a site. I put
in my credit information in each time instead of having
an account in standing, a little more time but less risks
involved! Of course, I mostly shop at my own Internet
mall and I know how safe it is there, credit card info is
deleted in a matter of seconds. Overall, I believe the web
to be a safe and very fruitful new frontier!

Yes. I had phenomena for 6 weeks and did not realize that
my ISP was shut down at the same time because the owner
was in a bad car accident.Â  I had a full service account.
My Internic fees were not paid so my WEB Address
went unprotected.Â  A Russian stepped in; paid the fees;
and, promptly assigned my www.SchoolOfGeomatics.com
address to a porn shop.Â  Thus, I lost 4 years of building
up 1st place rankings on 12 Search Engines and 2nd place
on 8 more.Â  This set me back about 4Â  months: I believe I
lost a minimum of $50,000.
Â 
I have also been hit with viruses about 10 times.Â  The first
time I lost almost 4 months of work.Â  Now, I back up often
enough to not to lose so much time.Â  This is also Internet
theft.Â  These people are nothing but out and out criminals
and should spend years behind bars.
Â 
Customers are well protected from credit card theft;
however, merchants can lose a lot of money.Â  I sell only by
purchase order and certified or registered company checks.

2821,"I'm fairly confused here, with Procmail. 
I know this isn't a procmail list per-se; feel free to answer my questions in 
private email to r_gilmanhunt@hotp.com.  I've looked for web-stuff to answer this question but I can't find anything 
specific on this scenario.Here's the situation. 
I have a global /etc/procmailrc file. It works, and when I insert stuff into 
it for logging (LOGFILE=/root/procmail.log, VERBOSE=yeah. LOGABSTRACT=all) it 
shows up where I expect it to (the log in /root/procmail.log)  At the end of 
this file, I use 
 :0fw
 | spamc
to call spamassassin.Also in it is a carboncopy recipe (yes, I know, it's one of the evils we do 
for our corporate masters)  (at the top) (to their credit, I am instructed 
that they are not interested in the actual contents, but are concerned about 
future lawsuits and their culpability, so they want a record made. Discussion 
on this point is immaterial)

 $SAVEATI have several users where I forward certain spams to /dev/null  . . .their 
procmailrc file (/home/$user/.procmailrc) looks like this:
:0
  * ^From: .*spermfun.com
  /dev/nullNow I've got a person who needs a copy of her inbound emails sent to another 
email address (outside the company), so I've got this recipe in her 
/home/$user/.procmailrc file:
:0 c
  !user@domain.tldIt almost looks like procmail's not running a user's copy recipe after a 
global copy recipe, except that I can replace that user's one with 
:0 
 * ^Subject: .*test
  procmail.holder
and get the same result.The result, to put it succinctly, is ""nothing"". No forwards go out, no files 
are made, if I try to log information, no logs are set up. I've modified the 
user/group and permissions to match known-working recipes (the spermfun 
example above) and still nothing.  However, I can redirect those other 
messages.  In other words- just this user's procmailrc file is not working- 
other users have no problems.Any suggestions would be helpful :) -Russ

Rohit===========================================================DataPower delivers XML acceleration device
ByÂ Scott Tyler Shafer
August 27, 2002 5:46 am PTDATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed 
specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that 
process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in 
hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, 
according to company officials.The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a 
family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The 
DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology 
called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML 
data.According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was 
conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future 
proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two 
businesses.""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. 
""The XA35 is the first of a family.""Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up 
to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on 
application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best 
alternative.In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount 
importance in the world of XML.""Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,"" Kelly 
said. ""A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. 
Firewalls are blind to XML today.""Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on 
security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML 
processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company 
itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed 
and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to 
creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly, 
adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly 
said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with 
technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes 
will be mostly false.
Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) 
accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet, 
while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes 
and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of 
XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language 
as they pass through the device.The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load 
balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify 
and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application 
co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular 
control over what data is inspected and the application server itself 
controls the device.DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup 
Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in 
May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a 
focus on content processing and acceleration.
The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The 
company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in 
field trails at a number of other enterprises.=========================================================================DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was 
founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who 
foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols 
would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML 
grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and 
designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique 
requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software 
interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing 
is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from 
developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team raised the bar 
and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In 
2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3â„¢), the 
industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.Today, XG3â„¢ technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML 
network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web 
Services. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of 
products, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, 
providing an immediate return on technology investments to 
industry-leading customers and partners.DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that 
brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries, 
drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including 
Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.=========================================================================DataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in FundingVenrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneer 
in XML-Aware Networking for Web ServicesCAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the 
leading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced 
that it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing. Investors for 
this round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed 
Capital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, of Mobius, 
and Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPowerâ€™s Board of 
Directors.DataPower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and 
sales of the companyâ€™s breakthrough technology for XML-Aware networking. 
Founded in 1999, DataPower invented the worldâ€™s first intelligent XML 
networkingÂ devices, capable of transforming XML traffic and transactions 
at the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services 
and other XML-centric initiatives. DataPowerâ€™s solutions are based on 
its patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3â„¢) technology.""Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and 
intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill 
prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. 
DataPowerâ€™s XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of 
XML that is required to support next generation enterprise 
applications,"" said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower 
Technology.""DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML thatâ€™s critical to Web 
services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance."" A single 
DataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 
serversâ€”breaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML 
processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In 
addition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, 
protection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of 
e-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing 
between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.""In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require 
laser-focused scrutiny. DataPowerâ€™s patent-pending technology addresses 
a very real and growing pain point for enterprises,"" said Michael 
Tyrrell of Venrock Associates. ""By turbo-charging their networks with 
DataPowerâ€™s unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be 
free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering 
performance and security pitfalls.""""We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly 
growing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and 
security,"" said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. ""DataPower is on 
their third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML 
Generation Three (XG3)Â technology was quite simply the single most 
compelling technology solution we have seen to date.""""XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious 
about optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been 
developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web 
services,"" said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. ""DataPowerâ€™s 
XML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely 
on XML for mission critical applications.""About Venrock Associates

Intel also had a similar device a couple of years ago (Netstructure).  They have, afaik, abandoned it.Intel is still in the XML hardware game though.  On 8/19 they spun off a company named Tarari.   Tarari develops hardware to check the headers of IP packets. Tarari calls 
this Layer 7 processing (atop the OSI model).    From what I can tell, Tarari plans to combine virus scanning and XML acceleration into a single hardware device.",0
2831,"Hardware acceleration for SSL makes sense since PKI can slow down a
transaction by as much as 1,000-fold. Per this article, XML formatting only
increases doc size by about 20-fold.. I'm not sure there are enough ""powers

Subject: DataPower announces XML-in-siliconNo analysis yet... don't know what to make of it yet. But here's the rawbits for all to peruse and check out what's really going on... Best, 
Rohit===========================================================DataPower delivers XML acceleration device
ByÂ Scott Tyler Shafer
August 27, 2002 5:46 am PTDATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed 
specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that 
process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in 
hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, 
according to company officials.The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in afamily of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. TheDataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology 
called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML 
data.According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was 
conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future 
proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two 
businesses.""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. 
""The XA35 is the first of a family.""Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size upto 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on 
application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best 
alternative.In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount 
importance in the world of XML.""Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,"" Kelly 
said. ""A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. 
Firewalls are blind to XML today.""Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on 
security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML 
processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the companyitself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed 
and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to 
creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly, 
adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly 
said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with 
technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes 
will be mostly false.
Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) 
accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet,while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytesand thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection ofXML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language 
as they pass through the device.The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load 
balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify 
and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an applicationco-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular 
control over what data is inspected and the application server itself 
controls the device.DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup 
Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch inMay, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a 
focus on content processing and acceleration.
The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The 
company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in 
field trails at a number of other enterprises.========================================================================
=DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was 
founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who 
foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols 
would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML 
grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and 
designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique 
requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software 
interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing 
is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from 
developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team raised the bar 
and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In 
2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3â„¢), the 
industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.Today, XG3â„¢ technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML 
network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web 
Services. While other companies are just now marketing first versions ofproducts, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, 
providing an immediate return on technology investments to 
industry-leading customers and partners.DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that 
brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries,drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including 
Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.========================================================================

and other XML-centric initiatives. DataPowerâ€™s solutions are based on 
its patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3â„¢) technology.""Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and 
intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill 
prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. 
DataPowerâ€™s XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of 
XML that is required to support next generation enterprise 
applications,"" said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower 
Technology.""DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML thatâ€™s critical to Webservices projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance."" A singleDataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 
serversâ€”breaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML 
processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In 
addition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, 
protection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of 
e-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing 
between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.""In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require 
laser-focused scrutiny. DataPowerâ€™s patent-pending technology addresses 
a very real and growing pain point for enterprises,"" said Michael 
Tyrrell of Venrock Associates. ""By turbo-charging their networks with 
DataPowerâ€™s unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be 
free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering 
performance and security pitfalls.""""We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidlygrowing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and 
security,"" said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. ""DataPower is ontheir third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML 
Generation Three (XG3)Â technology was quite simply the single most 
compelling technology solution we have seen to date.""""XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious 
about optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been 
developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web 
services,"" said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. ""DataPowerâ€™s 
XML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that relyon XML for mission critical applications.""About Venrock Associates

*Will Canada's ISPs become spies?*
By Declan McCullagh 
Staff Writer, CNET News.com

http://news.com.com/2100-1023-955595.html 
*WASHINGTON--The Canadian government is considering a proposal that 
would force Internet providers to rewire their networks for easy 
surveillance by police and spy agencies.*A discussion draft  
released Sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every 
Canadian with an Internet account, a plan that could sharply curtail the 
right to be anonymous online.The Canadian government, including the Department of Justice 
 and Industry Canada 
, wrote the 21-page blueprint as a near-final step 
in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to 
conduct electronic surveillance. A proposed law based on the discussion 
draft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in 
early 2003.Arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form, 
Canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and 
combat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting 
these proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the 
Council of Europe's cybercrime treaty 
, which the country is in the 
process of considering.If the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the 
possession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet 
providers to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and 
permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find ""hidden 
electronic and digital devices"" that a suspect might be concealing. In 
most circumstances, a court order would be required for government 
agents to conduct Internet monitoring.Canada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of 
Europe, and representatives from both countries' police agencies have 
endorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty 
, which has 
drawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups. 
Of nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted 
, 
or ratified, the treaty.Michael Geist , a professor at the 
University of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the 
justification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems 
weak.""It seems to me that the main justification they've given for all the 
changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to 
make changes,"" Geist said. ""To me that's not a particularly convincing 
argument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, 
make that case.""Geist added that ""there's nothing in the document that indicates (new 
powers) are needed. I don't know that there have been a significant 
number of cases where police have run into problems.""Probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is 
compelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure 
their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention 
orders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the 
Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act 
, but it 
applies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies.""It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and 
Internet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical 
capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national 
security agencies,"" according to the proposal. Companies would be 
responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment.Sarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center 
 (EPIC) who specializes in international law, says 
the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. ""Their 
proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not 
just Internet providers,"" Andrews said. ""The cybercrime treaty deals 
only with computer data."" EPIC opposes 
 
the cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and 
does not adequately respect privacy rights.Another section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs 
of Police recommends ""the establishment of a national database"" with 
personal information about all Canadian Internet users. ""The 
implementation of such a database would presuppose that service 
providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information,"" 
the draft says.Gus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an 
activist with Privacy International, calls the database ""a dumb idea.""""Immediately you have to wonder if you're allowed to use anonymous 
mobile phones or whether you're allowed to connect to the Internet 
anonymously,"" Hosein said.A representative for George Radwanski 
, Canada's privacy commissioner, said 
the office is reviewing the blueprint and does not ""have any comments on 
the paper as it stands.""Comments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca 
 no later than Nov. 15.

This is not a correct assessment.  The American public couldn't care
less.  However, the US intelligence community correctly perceives a
threat, and it isn't the third-world.  Many European and other developed
nations aggressively engage in covert operations against American
interests.  Its been going on for years and isn't even news.  Things
have stepped up in recent years and the US DoD is none too pleased.  For
better or worse, the US is relatively good at that game too.  As with
most backwater wars, they are proxies for the interests of the big
players.Find a current list of the top intelligence threats to the US.  You'll
find that half the countries on that list are European.  Most people are
unaware of how aggressive these things have gotten in recent years.

Bullshit.  The European governments ruthlessly suppress real opposition,
obviously some more than others.  US SpecOps are often brought in to do
dirty work inside Europe for European governments (usually with
government ""advisors"" along for the mission).  I've always wondered what
the deal was such that we got involved at all.  The point being that
we've acted as assassins for European governments inside their borders
against their own citizens under the auspices of those governments, and
in recent years, not ancient history.  I know SpecOp guys who left the
military specifically because of the circumstances of some of these
missions while they were posted for that duty. I'm certainly glad I was
never assigned missions in that theater, because there is a lot of
covert nastiness going on in nominally friendly European democracies.Regardless, giving money to people that threaten you has never created
meaningful peace in the history of civilization.  We call it extortion
under any other guise.

Europe is looking increasingly like a basket case.  Whatever problems
the US is having these days, Europe looks worse and is going downhill
faster.  Why the US would want to emulate European behavior or the
European way of doing things is beyond me.The US asking for major policy advice from Europe is like asking a quack
for medical advice.  I really don't see what is wrong with ""unilateral""
anyway.  Why should anyone join a stampede that is heading for a cliff?
I hope the incessant knee-jerk conformist screeching that Americans see
coming from Europe doesn't actually represent the views of Europeans. For various reasons I'm not exactly a cheerleader for the US government,
but the premises of the argument against them here are lame.

I'm betting you are underestimating the actual percentage.  The vast
majority of people I know have lived, worked, and traveled outside the
country at one time or another.  And I doubt Europeans have traveled
anywhere near as much in the Western hemisphere as Americans have. 
Despite the best efforts of France, Europe is *still* not the center of
the universe.  I'll throw you a bone though: most Americans do consider
Europe to be drifting into irrelevancy and therefore ignore it.  But
from the perspective of an American, how could you NOT look at it this
way?  The impact of Europe on America has diminished greatly over the
years.I love the smell of Euro-chauvinism in the morning.First, you assume that the North American continent is ethnically and
culturally homogenous.  Anybody that has actually traveled throughout
North America knows this isn't true; there are more than five major and
very distinct cultures and societies in the US alone, never mind the
hundreds of diverse regional sub-populations, some of which are truly
foreign.  Apparently Europeans confuse speaking the same language with
having the same culture.  That would be like saying Mexico is culturally
identical to Spain because they nominally speak the same language.  A
Wyoming rancher has almost nothing in common culturally or socially with
your average person living in San Francisco, despite speaking the same
language and nominally living in the same country.  If I want to visit a
wildly different culture for the holidays, I'll go to Oakland, New
Orleans, or similar -- they are far more different from where I live
than some countries I've traveled to.  And a lot of these places are
farther from where I live than Spain is from Germany.Second, the State I live in is the size of Germany.  When I travel to a
neighboring State (which I do regularly), how is this not equivalent? 
In fact, I probably travel much farther for the holidays than your
German construction workers.  If you look at the EU as a single country,
only then does your analogy become comparable.  What kind of ridiculous
superiority do Europeans get from having (relatively) tiny countries?In truth, I find Europe to be about as culturally homogeneous as the
US.  There are a lot of cultural similarities across the EU with
relatively minor local deviations that vary with distance in ways very
similar to the US.  The only real difference is that Europeans have
dozens of different languages, which is hardly something I would call an
advantage.  Although there are a couple parts of the US where I can't
understand a word they are saying either.

2837,"I got to see Powell talk in March 2001 at the beginning of his
reign at the FCC.  He said they were going to take a real
hands off approach, so it's funny that they would blame
the regulators for causing the collapse.  One thing he did
get right, is that he wasn't worried that the US was behind
Europe in the wireless licensing spectrum.  This is something
very prescient in that most of those licensors have had to
eat their lunch over the huge licensing costs they paid for
very little benefit.  His legacy was/is supposed to be
rethinking the FCC's role to stay out of the way in this
period of business innovation in the wireless space as he
didn't want the government forcing business models onto
the private sector.His full transcript is here [1].  Interestingly enough I
got to see his speech in person as he was part of the whole
CTIA'2001 Las Vegas keynote series of speakers.  Clay and
I hoped a flight out of Ontario to Las Vegas to do demo support
for Craig Barrett [2].  His message was that there's no difference
between wired and wireless Internet--it's all the same thing.
Instead of scalable networks, we should be thinking about scalable
content (& using Magi he showed sending a blue man tv commercial
from a desktop to a laptop to an ipaq to a color smartphone with
the content scaling back for each target platform).The best part of the whole trip wasn't hobnobbing at all,
but really the fact that the Venetian had ran out of rooms.
They decided to put us up in one of their $10,000/night high
roller rooms.  They put Clay in one and me in another.
The Venetian is known for having the largest hotel rooms
anywhere, but these ones were bigger than my whole house. 8-)Greg

I may be wrong but I think a single select entry field is used
for selecting messages and switching folders. Restricting the entries
to be numeric would break the folder switching functionality, wouldn't
it?My version of MsgChange, not yet updated, has a check    if {$msgid != {}} {
	# Allow null msgid from Msg_ShowWhat, which supplies line instead
	if {$msgid < 0}  return
    } else {
    ...at the start of the procedure which takes care of the single '-' case.
Perhaps the thing to do is for MsgChange to validate a msgid as a
number before continuing.KevinIn message <200208280108.VAA30178@blackcomb.panasas.com>, Brent Welch writes:

amazing what one can achieve when mains power fails, long enough for
UPS's to run out, and all that is left operational is the laptop and
its battery supply...)First, I put in some defensive code into the area where the problem was
occurring, so that if exmh is attempting (for any reason) to expand a
sequence that isn't either a number, or a range of numbers (or a list of
such things) it will simply ignore the trash, rather than giving a traceback.

 	set parts [split [string trim $range] -]
 	if {[llength $parts] == 1} {
 	    lappend seq $parts
That is amending proc MhSeqExpand which is where the error was occurring
before (the code assumes that $range is either NNN or NNN-MMM so we should
probably make sure that's true - issue an error instead of just ""continue""
if you like, but I don't think an error is needed).But that just allowed me to create a similar problem, in another place,
by typing ""NNN-"" ... and rather than continue to fight fires like this,
I thought I should think more about Brent's suggestion.   But rather than
have the selection code actually validate the input, which would mean it
would have to know what is to be valid, I decided that the right thing to
do is just to ignore any errors caused by invalid input, so I just stuck
a ""catch"" around the MsgShow that is processing the nonsense that the
user has typed.This way, any later expansion to what MsgShow treats as legal (maybe
allowing a sequence name, like ""prev"" or ""next"", or anything else can
be handled just there, without someone needing to remember that they have
to go fix the selection processing code to allow it.But, while I was playing there, I noticed something I never new before.
If you type ""66+"" the ""66"" changes to ""67"" (and so on, for each + that
is typed).   I suspect that's perhaps an artifact of ""+ is bound to a
different function so it can be used as a toggle between changing the
current and the target folder, but it has to mean something if the current
input mode is a message number, so let it mean..."", but now I found it,
I think its nice.    But if we can type 66+ why not 66- as well?  That
kind of limitation bugs me, so I fixed it.And then I wondered about folders with names containing '+' - the special
use of + as the toggle character means there's no way to type those from
the keyboard.   So I fixed that as well.   This makes two different
restrictions - there's no way to type a folder name that has a name
beginning with '+' (but such a thing in MH would be a pain to use anyway,
so I doubt this will bother anyone), and it is now only possible to
toggle between typing the current & target folder name when the name
being typed is empty.   I'm less happy about that part, but I think I
can live with it in order to allow folder names with +'s in them to
exist and be typed.Then, since I was there anyway, I decided to do something about another
feature that has always bugged me.   In ""normal"" keyboard mode, 's' is
the key used to show a message.    But if you've just typed 123, and
the FTOC is highlighting 123 as the current message, and you want to now
show that message, you can't type 's', you have to type \r instead.
So I ""fixed"" this one as well.   ""Fixed"" here is in quotes, as it assumes
that the keybinding for MsgShow is 's', if you change that to something
else, it will remain 's' in here.   I don't know enough tk/tcl to have it
discover what key is bound to a function in the external world in order
to bind the same one here.   \r continues to work of course.And now I got started in fixing irritants in this code, I also made it
clear the status line if you abort message/folder entry mode (^C or ^G).
Previously it used to leave the prompt sitting there until the next
message appeared, which made it less than obvious that the keyboard had
reverted to its usual bindings.In any case, what follows is the patch that does all of that.   I believe
that if you apply this, then the one above is probably not needed, the
""catch"" around the ""MsgShow"" will hide the problem (I don't think we really
need to fix Brent's way of invoking it).   Or include it anyway, just
for completeness (I haven't run an exmh with the following patch, but not
the previous one, so I don't know for sure that all will be OK then).kre--- select.tcl.WAS	Thu Aug 22 21:15:07 2002

    Message-ID:  <1030028647.6462.TMDA@deepeddy.vircio.com>  | hmmm, I assume you're going to report this to the nmh folks?It turns out, when I did some investigation, that my memory of how MH
worked here was wrong (that's not unusual) - the -seq switch seems to
have always done -nolist (requiring a subsequent -list to turn it on
again).Given that, I have no idea how the pick code as it was ever worked.  In
fact, it quite possibly never did the way it was intended to (I have just
been browsing the 2.5 sources, and that seems to be attempting to do things
that I never saw happen).It may be that your new sequence method just exposed the bug that had been
there all along.Given this, I won't be sending any bug reports to the nmh people.  If nmh
ever seems to be showing any signs further progress, and if I remember this
then, I might send them a change request.   The code to make the change is
trivial.kre_______________________________________________

is that the ftoc code wants to find that message to start its highlighting,
for example, or you are selecting a message to display. > It may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the current

But the thought of keeping an in memory list of valid messages is not fun.
Exmh already maintains in-core lists of messages in sequences, which is
already pretty tricky > Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the

but the sequence files are soo small that by the time you stat them to

we checkpoint message state on every message view, that file will change
every time.  In the old days exmh used to cache a bunch of state about
the folder.--

2862,"Well, I've used the check-the-modify-time cache trick for files in
many places (not just exmh) so some part of me certainly thinks it
is effective.  However, it occurred to me that if we do checkpoint
state, then aren't we modifying the sequences file for the current

more than once per message view?  Just idle speculation - we can
stick in some time calls to find out how expensive things are.Someone asked about increasing the time resolution in the exmh log.
We could make that conditional on some support available in 8.3 -
Tcl has had ""clock seconds"" (like gettimeofday) and ""clock clicks""
(high resolution timer) for some time.  But in 8.3 we've calibrated
clock clicks values to microseconds.  It is still only useful for
relative times, but each call to Exmh_Log could emit the microsecond
delta since the last log record.  Of course, we are measuring all
the overhead of taking the log record, etc.  I'll try it out.>>>Chris Garrigues said:

I can say I'll make any progress, but I may dabble.  Thanks again for
all your work in this area.  Generalized sequence support has been on
my to do list for about 8 years.--

But no.
Previously (v1.0.6 of GnuPG) there would be a slight pause at this point while
it went out to get the public key from a keyserver.
Now, whether I have the key or NOT, I get the failure message.Its as if it cant find gpg to execute it (but I fixed that path), so there
must be something else that I am missing...

byte-code compilation was added, and it is slightly more strict in
its parsing than the original parser.  You can only have a comment where
Tcl would expect to find a command.  Switch has a ""pattern - body""
strucutre, so if you goof and put a comment where it is trying to find
a pattern, both of you will be confused with the results.  The
subtlty arises with extra whitespace and newlines. I can't give you

I'm not quite clear how to reconfigure procmail/rcvstore/exmh to accept

That does not make a difference.It seems like procmail is the one that is actually reading the mail from

command line, if you use sh or ksh:	for f in `folders -fast -r`
	do
		echo sorting $f ...
		sortm +$f
	doneIt could take a long time.At work, I have to use Outlook.  Ick.  I hate it.  But it does a few
things right.  Like making indices for each folder, and not just by
date, but also by sender, message size, subject.  So I can sort by any
column instantly.I believe this is possible, too, with an IMAP compliant reader,
provided the IMAP server makes such indices.I am facing the fact that exmh has been left behind in some industry
standards.  I use it for my personal mail.  My mail server runs unix,
and I connect over ssh and tunnel my X traffic over ssh.  With a slow
link, this makes exmh very slow.  And mime handling is pretty bad
compared with modern mailers.  I am just scared to move.  I've been
using MH or nmh since 1985 and exmh since 1995.  17 years is a long
time!_______________________________________________

Wanting to sort like that is not common; I'd be surprised if exmh has
a widget for it.  You can achieve what you want with the command-line
mh tools, though.
I suggest doing the following from a shell prompt: sh -c 'for f in ""`folders -recurse -fast`"" ; do sortm +""$f"" ; done'(The command ""sortm"" will sort a particular folder, and
""folders -recurse -fast"" prints out a list of all of your folders.)
I hope this helps,

(Is that permitted? :)I started using linux about 8 or 9 years ago in rebellion against what the university was doing with Winder$.  I just couldn't get good support and was using a lot of unix-based tools (ported to Winder$) anyway. So, I jumped ship and became my own sysadm.What I got was the easy ability to use a shell (now ssh) to connect to my office box from just about anywhere and use either exmh or nmh (from the command line).  I can do email for the office fairly easily.I haven't seen any other tools that let me do that yet.  But, I have to admit, that some of the web-based mail software is getting pretty close.  Quoting and such is still primitive, but they're moving forward.-=d_______________________________________________

But there is a problem with making changes outside of exmh: the .xmhcache files 
don't get updated. This is dangerous; I have to remember to re-scan each folder 
I enter. Is there a safeguard for this?--

other corporate systems at risk, customer systems at risk, company
reputation and liability with customers at risk, and
proprietary/corporate data at risk.  Further, users cannot be reliably

Outlook use is considered to be somewhere between criminal negligence

It works very well in this fashion.FWIW, I use Eudora under Winder$ because it's less of a virus magnet.  :)There's more to the story why I run Winder$, but that's really off-topic and I'm already guilty!-=d_______________________________________________

display on a ""virtual X server"" created by vncserver on the home
box.  I connect to that virtual X server using vncviewer wherever
I happen to be.  The VNC connection is tunneled over ssh and is
carried over the Internet via an IPSEC appliance.That gives me access to both home and work email from either 
place without the complications involved in having two copies of 
exmh working on the same set of folders.It's a tad slow viewing work email when I'm at work ... but not 
so bad that I can't stand it.--Hal

The way to debug something like this is to turn on the log (Preferences 
-> Hacking Support -> Debug log enabled) and track the gpg commands 
being issued and the responses.FWIW, using exmh 2.5 and gpg 1.0.7 I do not have problems sending 
encrypted messages to myself. When I select the message, an xterm 
window pops up asking for the passphrase. I don't recall exmh ever 
asking me for the passphrase from the tty that started exmh nor from a 
dialog box. (But then again, I'm not a heavy gpg user).KevinIn message <200209111917.PAA02912@blackcomb.panasas.com>, Brent Welch writes:

Gotta wonder what the GPG config stuff in ~/.exmh/exmh-defaults looks 
like.  Also gotta wonder what the message headers in the offending 
message are saying to nmh/exmh.  My set-up works perfectly.  That is, 
I get a pop-up window to enter my passphrase into, and when I type it 
correctly, the message display changes from a prompt to click to 
decrypt to the message content.TTFN....On 11 September 2002 at 12:17, Brent Welch  wrote:Hmm - I'm cc'ing the exmh-workers list, because I really don't know

I am a (tv)twm user. when I snarf text into my mouse cut buffer, and then
attempt to inject it into the exmh input windows for comp/repl, the 'point'
is often an apparently random place in the text pane, not where I think I
have current flashing cursor. I usually wipe out any of To:/Subject:/ with the text. Its
often not even beginning of line denoted, ie its an unexplicable number
of char spaces in to the text where it inserts, What am I doing wrong in either X, WM, shell, EXMH which is causing this?cheers

gvim processes, but not into anything else.This is VERY annoying.  (I have to look at the message with cat or less or whatever in a
  terminal window if I want to do this - which is quite often.  And
  if the message is q-p encoded or a non-text/plain mime type, I end
  up with all that raw garbage too).Anyway to fix this?(BTW: standard i386 redhat7.3)Thanks.> kreCheers

be easy to add, though currently adding mouse bindings (something like
shift right click would be a good choice) is much harder than adding
key bindings.But note there's no need to ""undo"" - the way I generally use link, if
the desired destination folder isn't the current selected target, is
to right click on the target, which selects it and moves the message,
(and because I have the ""automatic move to the next message on move or
link option set) select the message again, and then ""Link"".Exmh only permits one uncomitted action to be selected for a message at a
time, that is, one of delete, move, or link.   Selecting any of those
implicitly undoes any previous choice from the three (so you cannot
achieve a ""move"" by doing a link, then delete, then commit, it needs to
be link, commit, delete, commit).  (xmh was just the same there incidentally).  | How's spring shaping up ""down under""?No meaningful comment from me, I'm not there at the minute.   But I'm told
that where I'm from it is cold, wet, and miserable, though has been better

model(s) of copy and paste.  Not in those words... but that
was how I read it. ;)I have a lot of trouble copying and pasting from or to exmh 
across a VNC link (from things in the vncviewer to things not in 
it and vice versa).  As long as I stick to apps being ""normally"" 
displayed on my X server I don't have much of a problem.My recollection from my X programming days is that the X model,
like everything in X, is more complex than the human brain can
handle.  It also is very different from the MS-Windows model.
And I get the feeling that Tk tries to ""unify"" those two models
and fails.  Not sure what the exmh-specific contribution to the 
confusion is, frankly.--Hal

co-workers. Updating my Gnome components has fixed it for me and
others, although I can't say exactly which component did the
trick. Gnomecore or gtk would seem most likely, but it may have been
something else.In any case, I have not seen the problem for quite a while, now.R. Kevin Oberman, Network Engineer

2915,"I've never understood the mouse buffer operation with exmh either. Here's the 
behaviour I have. I have exmh and XEmacs windows up, and a terminal window. (I 
also have gnome1.4 running and enlightenment as wm.) I select text in the exmh 
window and while it is highlighted, I can paste into anything else. If I select 
it and then click so the highlighting is off, then what I paste is not the 
recently-selected text in exmh, but an old selection. If I select in XEmacs and 
leave it highlighted, I can paste it into exmh sedit window; but if it is no 
longer highlighted, what I paste is an old selection. I can live with this 
behaviour except for one additional thing. If nothing is highlighted, then what 
I paste into exmh is different from what I paste into other windows. To be more 
specific, here's what gets pasted if nothing is highlighted:Application       What gets pastedXEmacs            whatever was last selected unless it was last selected in exmh
xterm             same as XEmacs
AbiWord           nothing
Nedit             nothing
sedit             Whatever was last highlighted in sedit and overwrittenThe last needs some amplification. If I highlight something in sedit, then 
obviously that's what gets pasted. If the highlighting is off, then what gets 
pasted is NOT what was last highlighted in sedit, but what was last highlighted 
and typed over (I have ""Type Kills SEL"" on.).It seems that exmh and sedit are the oddballs here. Very often when I try to 
paste something in sedit I end up muttering WTF??--

Hi Folks,I've been trying to set a button called which automatically
forwards mail using a '-form mycomps' without going through
the editor, but so far haven't got the right recipe.I currently have in my .exmh-defaults:*Mops.spam.text:        Spam
*Mops.spam.command:     Msg_Forward -form spamcomps -noedit -nowhatnowproc ; Msg
_Remove
I've also tried with ""SeditSend {$draft $t 0}"" after the forward command.
It should forward to a spam address (where filters get adjusted) and then
delete.  It does so, but not without producing the edit window.Any help appreciated.Wendy Roberts===========================================

currently highlighted.  In fact, it is the act of highlighting a
selection that actually copies that selection into the buffer.  X has
no ""copy"" command -- if you highlighted it, you just copied it.> This does not seem to override what is in an application's own

is something the application authors wrote on their own.  (And it it
likely that an application that wrote an internal ""copy"" command would
also have their own customized ""paste"" command, to make sure the two
work together.)  Whether the internal (custom) select and paste
functions interoperate with the X server's global select and paste
functions will vary from program to program, because in each case you
are relying on the program's authors' efforts to blend separate systems.

ALSA audio devices for locally logged in users (through the console.perms

demand. Also, aumix and the scripts that come with Red Hat Linux still work
for controlling the volume, so it's still saved and restored when the
computer is halted, even using ALSA.I'm glad you got your card working with these! I'm now wondering if I won't
maybe buy an amplifier that supports Dolby Digial decoding (my current one
""only"" does PRo Logic) since I've read that ALSA supports the S/PDIF
optical output of the sound chip of my Shuttle!

Also, you could try ""alsactl store"", editing /etc/asound.state"" by hand

it to install an ""alsa-kernel"" for the original kernel (you've kept it,
right? ;-)) and install ALSA modules from source for custom kernels built

you absolutely detest qt and some programs are rebuildable from sources
with different %configure options. You can get src.rpm, edit spec, bump
release numberwith your initials and another number and rebuild, insert
into apt and let loose... :)Doesn't freshrpms have updates dir too? Maybe not quite as up to date as
up2date but still. I would never use up2date. There is another
repository at apt-rpm.tuxfamily.org IIRC. Not sure if that had The
updates._______________________________________________

file not found, it's because the source rpm was installed. To see if this

you'll just need to do ""rpm -bb mplayer.spec"" to get a binary build in

Its a little confusing but you install rpms like
rpm -ivh packagename-0.1.1.rpm 
uninstalls must be done without the version info like
rpm -e packagename   ie: rpm -e sendmail or 
rpm -e sendmail-devel. give that a go and it should work np. Phil,

It may freely be commented on or used in another text.I have a directory like this:

.
|-- current7
|   |-- SRPMS.current
|   |-- SRPMS.gcc3
|   `-- redhat
|       |-- RPMS.current

`-- testing
    |-- SRPMS.testing
    `-- redhat
        |-- RPMS.testing
        `-- base27 directoriesI throw updates to current7's rpms and my own stuff (with makefile :) to
testing.
After each new package, 
nice genbasedir -s --progress --topdir=$TOPDIR/ \
testing/redhat testing(for -s to work, you need to make release files, pinch someones for
exmple)This stuff is found under apache. I put that url, my keys and all that
into apt conf on the machines on the network and apt away.As for .fi mirrors, funet is very slow. I think I use tuxfamily for
updates but when I see errata I usually also put that to my own one so
rest of the machines have a shorter path to it.
Funet hosts a whole load of mirrors and projects (it used to be (is?)
the main mirror for Linux. It was one of the big pub ftp sites). If
there was a definite apt repository, maybe they might mirror that as
well. I doubt RH would be very keen on using apt and forking a
distribution doesn't seem like an easy option, someone should just start
a project.--

I think it won't do anything about the kernels. Come to think of it, the

everything. Worked ok. I think there'll be a few .rpmnew files worth
checking such as, especially, passwd and group.

was a mess, still, it went much faster and smoother than if I had done it

should work though... I still prefer backuping config files and
reinstalling a clean system when I have the time.Matthias--

it's really wonderful! Ever tried of completely uninstalling all openssh
related packages while being connected through ssh? Well, it works!!!! Of
course, if the connection cuts at that moment, you're stuck, but a simple
upgrade with official Red Hat packages also works like a charm :-)Matthias--

make a dummy package, right?I was wondering that this is a bit dangerous if there is a update for my 
software, as the dummy package might get updated with it overwriting the 
installation I've done from source... Not good.Is there really no ""--nodeps"" kind of switch in apt-get? --

^kernel$ matches ""kernel"" and nothimg more.
Kerne, kernel-smp and kernel-enterprise are the kernel packages you
might be running in a RH system. Packages like kernel-headers,
kernel-BOOT and kernel-doc aren't matched. If it just said ""kernel"", it
would match *all* those packages.--

3005,"Hi,Just the kind of announce I make once in a while :
- I've rebuilt a new ""alsaplayer"" package based on Angle's one.
- I've rebuilt a hopefully final version ""-fr8"" of the ""alsa-driver"" and
  ""alsa-kernel"" packages which fix all known SMP build issues.Both can be found here :
http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/I've also repackaged gkrellm 2.0.2 with at last a separate package for the
server that can be installed standalone and doesn't even require glib2.
http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/gkrellm/Last but not least, my latest proftpd 1.2.6 package incorporates some nifty
new features : You can use any of ""--with ldap"", ""--with mysql"" and ""--with
postgres"" when rebuilding the source rpm with rpmbuild to enable desired
extra authentication methods and all package requirements are set
accordingly, and the release tag is changed too.
http://valhalla.freshrpms.net/ (the usual place ;-))I think I'll use this ""--with "" switch more and more where
possible. Some other of my package already use it like the xmame for its
output targets, sqlrelay for its modules and my latest sylpheed claws spec
to enable Pilot support.As usual, feedback and comments are welcome! :-)MatthiasPS: Yup, I'm back from my holidays ;-)--

change deeply the way a package is built. Its use would be more like
enabling/disabling gpg, ldap, whateversql support in packages as it's not
possible to use something like ""--with-="" which could be used for

probably not play mp3 files. But alsaplayer does play mp3s ""out of the box"".Also, they are developing rapidly in their CVS and looks like their next version

run (manually copied into /usr/lib/win32/), but personally, I've been very
happy with mplayer's default (which is ffmpeg's ffdivx decoder) for nearly
all the DivX files I used. The only ones that still require (from my own
experience) the use of the win32 codecs are the ones encoded with a strange
DivX 3 sound format... and I've really not seen any quality or speed
improvements when using them.Matthias> On Sat, Jun 08, 2002 at 11:39:03PM +0200, Axel Thimm wrote:

for cut/paste, but as usual mandates no *policy*.  Windows and Macintosh
have a slightly different mechanism and one uniform policy.  I'm quite
sure that Tk implements all PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD selections accurately.
The PRIMARY selection is the one that is tied to the visible selection
on your X display.  The CLIPBOARD selection is the one with the explicit
Copy step, and is the same as what you have on Windows and Macintosh.
However, exmh throws in support for the cutbuffer mechanism, which is
another archaic mechanism supported at one point (perhaps still today)
by versions of emacs.  Exmh has a policy that tries to unify all these
mechanisms under one umbrella, and by all reports it is not that great.I would encourage folks to play with those 10 lines of code in
Text_Selection and report what works well for them.  We may come up
with 8 lines that work for everyone, or perhaps introduce yet another
setting that lets folks choose between a few useful models.  Of course,
that's an admission of policy failure, but I'm willing to do that.--

have almost no problems with the choice of what gets pasted, or
selected, that stuff (for me, if perhaps not users of some gnome variant,
which appraently has been fixed anyway) all seems to work just fine.The problem is that a button 1 click clears the selection (PRIMARY)
where it shouldn't - the previous selection should only be cleared
when there's something else to replace it (even if the highlighting
of what is selected is removed).     Try this in any other ramdom
application (from xterm to netscape) and see how it works.  There
normally is *no* (mouse based) way to actually clear the primary
selection (that is, set it to be a null string).Then, because of the ""if I get asked for the selection value, I will
find something"" behaviour, if you click (intending to set the insert
point, the way most other GUI's operate), and then paste, because the
PRIMARY is clear, but exmh still owns the selection, because nothing
else has taken it, it does and finds some other ramdom stuff, from
either the clipboard or cut buffer, which tends to be something that was
deleted back in the ancient past, and pastes that.That behaviour, to me anyway, is the real issue.Once that gets fixed, we can switch back to operating the normal
""select stuff, click at new insert point, paste"" mode of operation
that almost everyone expects to work (whether the ""select stuff""
is somewhere in one of the exmh windows, or elsewhere).kreps: this message is from my experience as a exmh user only, I've never
really understood enough about X and selections to go gazing at that
part of the code and see how it all really operates._______________________________________________

may not play well with recent changes.  (I did look at 2.5.1, too).
And, I just did this off the top of my head (I wanted to see if it
(**) still worked), so this is somewhat untested.Adding a menu entry is trivial; add this to your ~/.exmh/exmh-defaults:*Fops.more.m.uentrylist:	ketchup
*Fops.more.m.l_ketchup:		Catch-up all b4 cur
*Fops.more.m.c_ketchup:	 	My_Mark2CurSeenThen you just need to provide the source for My_Mark2CurSeen and 
arrange for Exmh to include it (put it in your ~/.tk/exmh directory
in your user.tcl; or in pick.patch if you enable the ""source hook""
under Prefs->Hacking Support)It's going to look something like this:proc My_Mark2CurSeen {} {
    global exmh pick msg
    Exmh_Status ""Clearing unseen up to cur..."" red
    Mh_SetCur $exmh(folder) $msg(id)
    set pick(ids) [...get message ids for ""pick 1-cur""...]
    busy PickMarkSeen
    Exmh_Status ok blue
}(that's based upon the guts of Pick_MarkSeen)You need to fill in the code for the [...get...] section; I ran out of
time!John(*) ""It just works"" (tm)

It seems that something changed during the last 3-4 weeks.1) In a folder, msgs 1-n is read, n=current, n upwards is unread.
2) change to another folder
3) change back to the original folder and you'll see msg n+1 being 
highlighted as current for a split second, that it changes back to 
n=current.Kind of annoying since it marks msg n+1 as read./Anders_______________________________________________

	When I do that, it just moves my mouse to the very edge of a window
(probably trying to center it on the off-screen window in question.) 	I'll have to try it with another window manager and see if I can
get exmh to put it back inside of sane boundaries. I don't have this
problem with any other windows, though. Just the exmhunseen window.Pat_______________________________________________

	As Hal noted, I like to have the unseen window visible in all
virtual desktops, even if the main window is minimized. However, I looked
through ALL the preferences menus, and didn't see anything resembling ""Show
unseen message count in folder cache"". Where is that? And in what version?
(I'm running v2.4 - 06/23/2000 - Creaky, I know.)	I went into twm with no virtual desktops, and it came up just fine.
Going back to Enlightenment I saw the same behavior as before. Then I knew
it MUST be something in the window manager, so I went digging. in my 
~/.englightenment/...e_session-XXXXXX.snapshots.0 file I found all the
settings that E. uses for remembering border styles, positions, shaded
state, etc. 
	I have a 1600x1200 screen, and it kept putting my window at
1655x150 (AND had it shaded to boot, so it was tiny as well as offscreen!)
	Searching for 'unseen' in that file found this section:NEW: exmh.Exmh
NAME: exmh
CLASS: Exmh
NEW: unseen.UnseenWin
NAME: unseen
CLASS: UnseenWin
DESKTOP: 0
RES: 1600 1200
WH: 114 173
XY: 1655 150 0 0
LAYER: 4
STICKY: 1
SKIPTASK: 0
SKIPWINLIST: 0
SKIPFOCUS: 0
SHADE: 2
BORDER: PAGER_LEFT_BLUE	I changed:
XY: 1655 150 0 0  	to 
XY: 1455 150 0 0	so it would reappear in my viewable space,
restarted Enlightenment (CTRL-ALT-End) and then restarted exmh. Bingo!
There was my window! 	I quickly told Englightenment to forget everything about that
window except is border style, and now have a sveldt little entry like so:NEW: exmh.Exmh
NAME: exmh
CLASS: Exmh
NEW: unseen.UnseenWin
NAME: unseen
CLASS: UnseenWin
BORDER: PAGER_LEFT_BLUE	Completely an Enlightenment problem, not exmh. (Though I wonder how
it got mixed up in the first place? I certainly can't move a window off
screen like that. Unless it was part way over then snapped offscreen when
shading.)	Hmm. Weird. 	Anyway, thanks for the suggestions, folks. Hopefully this will be
useful to someone scouting the archives in the future... :-) -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----

nothing at all to do with ""pick"" except that it (ab)uses the pick(ids) var
in the same way.   (Its name would be hard to change unfortunately, as it
is known in app-defaults files for the ""Catch Up Unseen"" menu item, but
its implementation could certainly be fixed).kre_______________________________________________

I apologize for not catching up to the current code in so long.Now that I have I'm trying to resolve ""breakage"" and differences.The unseen window seems to have been replaced with the sequences 
window.  While I appreciate the flexibility of the sequences 
window, the unseen window filled an important-to-me need:  It 
was tiny and could be set to show on all desktops of a virtual 
window manager without taking a lot of space.  Since my normal 
mode of operation involves two copies of exmh displaying on a 
1024x768 vnc session, screen space is at a premium.As things stand now, I have a sequences window that shows a lot
more information than I need to have handy and takes up a lot 
more room than I can ""spare"".I can see that I could like the new sequences window a lot for 
certain operations.  But I'd like a nice uncluttered, tiny 
window that _only_ shows me info on my unread mail.One possibility that occurs to me would be a button or mouse
click that ""shrinks"" the Sequences window to show only the
sequences in the ""always show"" list.  And of course a way to 
expand it back.--Hal

I have a couple of small issues, and I'm not sure if their exmh issues
or my setup issues.First, when I try and run exmh with wish from tk8.4.0 it seems to take
forever to start, but with wish from tk8.a.4 it starts in a snap.Using the latest CVS, when I open exmh and the folder I'm in has unseen
messages and I hit next, exmh changes to the next folder with unseen messages
rather than to the first unseen in the current folder.Finally, when I reach the end of the messages in a folder and go on to
the next unseen, exmh always goes back to inbox (which has no unseen
messages) rather than the next folder with unseen messages.  (When I 
goto next from inbox it does go where I would think it should go).Just wanted to let you know what I'm seeing and find out if I'm expecting
some different than I should be.Thanks for all the effortJim

Ah.  Neither Ted nor I were particularly up to date.  I pulled 
down the lates from CVS and am now running with it.  I miss the 
blue ftoc lines but I'll sort that out soon, iirc Chris said 
it's a simple resource change.Ted's code to ""ketchup"" made use of some of the procs that went 
away in the sequence generalization.  I've fixed it up... almost 
and it looks like this now:proc Cabeen_Mark2CurSeen {} {
    global exmh mhProfile msg
    set results {}
    Exmh_Status ""Clearing unseen up to cur..."" red
    Mh_SetCur $exmh(folder) $msg(id)
    set unseen [Mh_Sequence $exmh(folder) $mhProfile(unseen-sequence) ]
    foreach elem $unseen {
         if { $elem <= $msg(id) } {
            lappend results $elem
         }
    }
    busy Seq_Del $exmh(folder) $mhProfile(unseen-sequence) $results
    Exmh_Status ok blue
}
The ""almost"" is because it's not updating the highlighting on 
the ftoc.  I'm too tired to go figure out how to fix that just 
now and have to move on to other stuff.  If someone wants to 
forward me a clue feel free.Now that I've got all of Chris' sequence stuff I discovered that 
my sequences are ... cluttered.--Hal

Hi,succeeded in ringing a bell anytime I get a mail
to my inbox (Not Mailing lists, spams etc.) by
using procmail to execute a ""play clink.wav"" on
the ""right"" mails.
Now my demands are growing ;-)
I use my laptop remotely very often and now I would
like the bell to sound on that when I am there.
I triedto use the KDE remote sound server and it works in
the tests, but when procmail runs it it doesn't, presumably
as it doesn't have the authorization to communicate with
the laptop, beeing another user?Any hints.BRGDS

procmail is run by the qmail delivery agent to presort all mail
I get.
But anyway, I found an error message in procmail.log, which solved
the problem.
The following line in my delivery script seems to work fine now:DISPLAY=:0.0 artsplay ThanksDag

relief from raised to sunken.   I don't know why, but it just looks better

Works like a charm. It's like the box was on drugs or something. However, while testing it a selected my favourite folder (l-k) and

Catch-up Unseen did before. Any suggestions?/A

I had GPG working.
I updated from version gnupg-1.0.6 to gnupg-1.0.7.
This moved gpg from /usr/bin to /usr/local/bin and I changed the path
in the exmh 'executable'.With that fix, EXMH knows I have GPG, and puts the line	Check the signature with GnuPGin messages with GnuPG signatures.  But punching the line ALWAYS
gives        Signature made Thu Aug 29 00:27:17 2002 MDT using DSA key ID BDDF997A
        Can't check signature: public key not foundSo, something else is missing.
Can somebody tell me what it is,- Ive tried grepping on everything

With exmh getting upset by two instances running at the
same time, this creates the problem that I cannot  run to the
closest compter to check out the new mail.But thanks for the hint, I might use that for some other

Check the procmail documentation.  They actually recommend:""|IFS=' '&&p=(PATH/TO/PROCMAIL)&&test -f $p&&exec $p -f-||exit

that the freeze on package versions for inclusion in the next stable
release (n+1) has already happened, thus you'll have to wait at least for
Red Hat Linux... n+2 :-)This is why (if it doesn't break anything), I'll maybe release recent
aspell packages. But to be sure I'll need to do some testing ;-)Matthias--

3086,"Hi,Red Hat 8.0 is released tomorrow (monday).  I took some time out to make 
RPMs of GStreamer for it.All of them (core, plugins and player) have been uploaded to the apt 
repository in a new ""redhat-80-i386"" directory.The repository for dependencies is again called ""deps"", and the one for 
the gstreamer rpms is ""redhat"", because this time around the base distro 
contains all the necessary packages.A screenshot of Red Hat 8.0 running gst-player is up at
http://thomas.apestaart.org/download/screenshots/redhat-80-gst-player.png
Here are some known issues with the resulting rpms :a) gstreamer-nautilus isn't built, the package got renamed and I don't 
have a -devel package for it yetb) the c++ plugins have problems which I haven't been able to resolve.
Here are the errors:INFO (15299: 0)gst_xml_registry_rebuild:1555: Plugin

rebuilt for Valhalla). Then you upgrade to Psyche using the Red Hat CDs.
Hopefully with the compat libraries the package will still be there
(although I doubt that since C++ is binary incompatible, so this is
probably a bad example), then you ""apt-get update"" with the new Psyche
repository... and there's where the problem will be : It will say that
there are two synaptic-0.24-fr1 packages (one installed, the other
available) with the same version but different dependencies :-/
That's why I always keep package versions lower for older distributions.Matthias--

version.  That doesn't mean it can't work, it means nobody tried it, they 
sure didn't test it or fix anything to make it work, and you're on your 
own.second, historically a new .0 numbers mostly means ""so much has been 
changed that you might have problems upgrading from any previous release 
anyway"".  So, historically, most users installing a .0 release do this 
from scratch anyway, doing upgrades throughout x.0->x.y.If you want to avoid problems, bite the bullet and reinstall ;)Thomas -- The Dave/Dina Project : future TV today ! - http://davedina.apestaart.org/

(unimportant) catch is to replace ""kernel-headers"" by ""glibc-kernheaders"",
a simple ""apt-get install glibc-kernheaders"" taking care of that.Upgrading between releases is meant to work, not between betas or beta and
releases. The reason is simple : Some packages may have been downgraded,
some others may have been rebuilt with the same versions but different
dependencies. For both these categories of packages, the upgrade through
apt/rhn/whatever just won't do, as some older packages might be considered
as the newest, thus being kept on the system.As Red Hat does, I really don't recommend trying to upgrade between betas
or from a beta to a final release either. Simply backup your /home, /etc
(and /root and/or /usr/local/ if needed) then reinstall cleanly, it'll
probably save a few hassles and you'll get the cleanest possible system ;-)Matthias--

against using Red Hat that makes no sense at all.  I for one am GLAD that 
they 
a) don't overwrite your config files on a whim (be GLAD they don't do some 
sort of autodetection and changing crap)
b) tell you on rpm upgrade what config files you should look at because 
formats have changed.Red Hat is not ""taking it easy"" on this, it's putting control in the hands 
of you, the maintainer of the machine.  Don't be lazy.> Anyway, I have tons of media files in /home/* probably 5 to 10 gigs at least, my

/home on a separate partition, no ? Just install rh80 and tell it to use 
the same partition as /home and tell it to NOT format it, but keep the 
data as is.If you didn't put /home on a separate partition, then you really do need 
to make backups.  Use an nfs or smb mount from another machine to backup 
and rsync straight to the mount, or if that's not possible, rsync over 
ssh.  It's the best way to make backups.> These media files are backed up - ON THE CD'S THEY CAME FROM! It's the other way around - your media files are backups of the CD's they

against something that wasn't installed through rpm :-/What I'd recommend in your case : You should keep at least one original Red
Hat Linux kernel (you do just in case, right? ;-)) and install the matching
alsa-kernel package as you'll need at least one because of the
dependencies. Then for your custom built kernel, simply ""./configure
--with-cards=all && make && make install DESTDIR=/tmp/alsa-driver"" from the
alsa-driver sources then as root copy all the modules under
/tmp/alsa-driver/lib/modules/ to your modules dir and run ""depmod -a"".Of course you can even make it much faster by not compiling all un-needed
drivers, as I guess that's one of the reasons one would rebuild his own
kernel.I find this the easiest and cleanest way to get around the problem. It's
what I've done and what I'll keep doing on my laptop where I'm running a
kernel recompiled with ACPI.Matthias--

installs no files but claims to produce a kernel package having version
number `uname -r` for architecture `uname -p`.  It also claims to
provide kernel-sources at the same version.  That is enough to make

Anyway, although I'd easily recommend upgrading 7.x to 7.3 using apt, I

edited or installed some files. For me that's only /etc/, /root/ and
/home/. Then you reinstall cleanly, formating ""/"", put your /home/ files
back into place and you're ready to go.
That's the moment I usually realize I had a nifty tweak to a file in
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ or some special parameters added to an
/etc/modules.conf entry... so I look at my backup and make the same change
again. The only thing where you can get stuck is the grub.conf files,
because although there's a /etc/grub.conf link, it's actually in
/boot/grub/ so you may want to copy it too if you have special kernel
parameters to save (I have to pass ""pci=bios,biosirq"" for one of my
computers to work for example).HTH,

you sent doesn't support packages named ""kernel-smp""). I'd also prefer a
cleaner way than the env variable, and preferrably not editing the spec...
probably ""--define 'target 2.4.xx-xx' --with smp"". Sound good enough?
The BuildRequires on ""kernel-source"" will also need to be removed because
it won't necessarily need to be true, and that does bug me a bit :-/More ideas are welcome.

been aiming for, but the freaking RedHat Kernel srpms still have been stump 
...	If we could get this and the alsa driver stuff working, it would be whole 
lot easier to try out a newer kernel ... but then the size of these rpms

idea ...Thanks guys.

The new spec didn't even want to build the package
something with config.mak
Also this new spec looks like the old one, it got libdv and libdv-devel
in the BuildRequires so I just used the normal spec and removed it manully.Roi

    Damn, this thing is slick.  Someone seems to have done a very complete QA test on it; yesterday I installed it for the first time on an old Celeron box.  Sure, parts of it were slow, but compared to my more modern machine, everything is.  It was good; a beautiful interface that legions of 'sheep' can look at and say ""Cool; I can understand this"" and leave their shackles behind.  :)    I was struck by the massive amount of applications, both KDE and Gnome, intuitively seperated NOT by the Gnome/KDE names, but by their **meanings** instead.  It's obvious that someone spent a lot of time improving the usability and graphics to make it more 'international'; the web browser graphic, for example, has a 'world' icon with a mouse wrapped around it. Office-apps have familiar pens, paper, and/or calculators involved.    This is a Linux that I can plop down in front of almost anyone, and they can figure it out.    At some point I'd miss the character of KDE/Gnome, and I'll probably 'hotrod' the graphics setup with my own themes, etc.  But for the wide release, this one's IT.  If you get a chance, try this; I think you'll be surprisingly pleased.

could use my laptop's ESS chip best (hard disk recording and such). Wow, maybe 8 to
10 months, time flys. I didn't look forward to doing that tedious build every time I
changed a kernel or something. Matthias has made this a thing of the past! Dude,
it's a no brainer, use apt-get or just download and install.What's more, OSS is fully ""imitated"", older apps using OSS are as happy as a clam.
My personal taste tells me newer apps which use alsa sound better (alsaplayer, xmms
with alsa module) to my ear.The 2 things that trick people are the modules.conf file, they didn't have that
automatic matrix page when I started with alsa, you don't know how good you have it.And on my old installs (only the first time I installed it on a clean box), alsa
always was ""muted"" until you fire up a mixer and turn up the music. It's possible
Matthias even took care of that too. Anyway it is/was only a one time thing on 1st
install, that was a long time ago for me.Those ALSA dudes had been trying to get it into the 2.4 kernel but missed it, but
it's been in 2.5 for a while now, so alsa is the future of sound in the linux kernel.--
That's ""angle"" as in geometry._______________________________________________

you're gonna go to the trouble of packaging custom kernels into rpms,
it's not a far stretch to package the source tree too (as I currently
do).Also, I've found that the alsa-driver source needs a usb-related patch

people seeing the same thing, or is this just a problem with my setup?garyP.S. If I didn't mention it before, thanks for the alsa packages! They

default.
You should be able to get rid of those two though, by rebuilding the source

If no /dev/dvd exists, it'll create it.
If /dev/dvd exists, it won't touch it.
If someone installs ogle (a DVD player), I'm assuming the hardware is
recent enough for software playback and that the drive is a DVD-ROM... all
of them support DMA! But since that change requires a reboot or a manual
change, I'm still hesitating to integrate it :-/My goal is to allow users to install a DVD player through synaptic and play
DVDs in no time. Outputting a message in the %post section of a package is
always a bad idea, putting the tip in the %description sounds good though.Matthias--

[...]All of these ""af6"" are related to avifile6 support :-/
Normally, my 0.6.1-fr2 build of transcode defaults to *not* use avifile,
but you can use ""--with avifile6"" to force recompiling against it.Do you have an old avifile installed maybe?
Can you check the ""./configure ..."" line run at the beginning of the
rebuild process to see if it does include the ""--without-avifile6"" option?Matthias--

are unfortunate enough to have a DVD drive (or just an ordinary CD,
non-DVD drive) that doesn't support DMA will be left with a system
without a working CD drive, even after removing the RPM.  And without

although there probably is since Red Hat decided to default disabling it a
few releases back :-/
Normally, even if you try to enable DMA and your device doesn't support it,
it simply don't be able to make the change, and that's it. The problem IIRC
is with crappy hardware that is supposed to support DMA but doesn't work as
expected when it's enabled... maybe Chris could confirm this? ;-)I guess I'll settle for the /dev/dvd link change as described and putting
the DMA tip in the %description :-)Matthias--

Yes it was there.
You guessed the problem correctly in an earlier e-mail There was still
remnants remaining from an old failed avifile installation.
The transcode src.rpm now builds perfectly.

OK, so I'll follow Red Hat's choice of leaving the DMA setting alone and

Your first example is a good one, because I really think it's even easier
currently :
1. Leave your current kernel as-is
2. Get the ""alsa-driver"" source rpm
3. Rebuild and install resulting packagesDrivers that are written to be easily compiled as modules (like ltmodem,
NVidia, ALSA etc.) can easily be repackaged separately as rpms and ported
as easily for various kernel rpms from the source rpm.Also, what you describe is sort of the opposite of what rpm packaging is in
my mind. I see it more as a ""one size fits all"" achievement in the general
case. And kernel isn't an exception (although there are packages optimized
for various processors) since they all come with just about all the modules
you'll ever need. Make that ""one size fits many"" then if you want ;-)Last but not least : The kernel is something I'm trying to keep away from
in my packaging since I really don't want to see newbies screwing up their
systems because of packages on my website... same goes for GNOME, KDE and
other major bits of the distribution since I also want people who happily
use my packages to be able to upgrade to the next Red Hat Linux release
without having their system turned into another Ximian mess.MatthiasPS: Yes Chris, I'm worried about not giving you too much work! Less in fact
since you can easily answer ""freshrpms.net!"" to people asking how to play
DVDs, right? ;-))))--

trying to install the Perl libraries into the system's, and also at the

3203,"BlogStart: **Dublin**: something from the archives.    Daev Walsh forwards an article from
The Irish Digest about ''Billy in the Bowl''.  This story is also immortalised
in an old Dublin song, which in turn was mentioned in a Pogues track.  Billy
was a legless beggar in the alleys of Stoneybatter and Grangegorman (where I
now live) during the 18th century, who discovered a new, but not entirely
legal, way to make money.BlogEnd: 
LinkText: Billy in the BowlFrom:         daev 
Subject:      The Case of the Stoneybatter StranglerA story of my new neighbourhood...
The Irish Digest July 1964
The Case of the Stoneybatter StranglerThe handsome, deformed Billy in the Bowl evolved a plan to rob his donors.
Then, one night, he made the biggest mistake of his life DUBLIN in the eighteenth century was noted for two things - the
architectural beauty of its public buildings and the large number of
beggars who sought alms in its maze of streets and lanes.  Many of these
beggars relied on visitors and the gentry for their coin, but there was one
who campaigned among the working class.  This was ""Billy In The Bowl""The strange appellation was derived from the fact that Billy's sole means
of transport was a large bowl-shaped car with wheels.  Seated in this ""
bowl "", the beggar would propel himself along by pushing against the ground
with wooden plugs, one in each hand.Billy's unusual means of conveyance was vitally necessary, as he had been
born without legs.  Nature, however, had compensated for this by endowing
him with powerful arms and shoulders and, what was most important, an
unusually handsome face.This was Billy's greatest asset in his daily routine of separating
sympathetic passers-by from their small change.The cunning young beggar would wait at a convenient spot on one of the many
lonely roads or lanes which were a feature of eighteenth century
Grangegorman and Stoneybatter, until a servant girl or an old lady would
come along.He would then put on is most attractive smile which, together with his
black curly hair, never failed to halt the females.  The fact that such a
handsome young man was so terribly handicapped physically always evoked pity.""Billy in the Bowl"", however, wasn't satisfied with becoming the daily
owner of a generous number of small coins; what his greed demanded were
substantial sums of money.  The more he managed to get the more he could
indulge in his pet vices - gambling and drinking.As a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers.
The first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold March evening
as dusk, was falling.  The victim was a middle aged woman who was passing
through Grangegorman Lane on her way to visit friends in Queen Street - on
Dublin's North Quays.When Billy heard the woman's footsteps, he hid behind some bushes in a
ditch which skirted the lane.  As his unsuspecting victim drew close, the
beggar moaned and shouted, and cried out for help.Trembling with excitement, the woman dashed to the spot where Billy lay
concealed.  She bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch, when two
powerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes.In a few minutes it was all over.  The woman lay in a dead faint, and Billy
was travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his "" bowl "", his victirn's
purse snug in his coat pocket.  An hour after the robbery the woman was
found in a distracted condition, but failed to give a description of her
assailant.  And, as ""Billy in the Bowl"" had figured, nobody would suspect a
deformed beggar.Again and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan, always shifting
the place of attack to a different part of Grangegorman or  Stoneybatter.On one occasion "" Billy in ""the Bowl "" tried his tactics on a sturdy
servant girl who put up such a vigorous resistance that he was forced to
strangle her.  The incident became known as the 11 Grangegorman Lane Murder
and caused a great stir.Hundred.s flocked to the scene of the crime and for a couple of months
""Billy in the Bowl"" was forced to desert his usual haunts.  Around this
period, Dublin's first-ever police force was been mobilised, and the first
case they were confronted with was the Grangegorman lane murder.Months passed and  ""Billy in the Bowl"" reverted once again to his old
pasttime.  A number of young servant girls were lured into ditches and
robbed, and the police were inundated with so many complaints that a
nightly patrol was placed on the district.  But the beggar still rolled
along in his ""bowl"" pitied and unsuspected.  Then came the night that
finished Billy's career of crime.Two stoudy built female cooks, trudging back to their places of employment
after a night out in the city, were surprised and not a little shocked to
hear shouts for help.  Rushing over, they came upon a huddled figure in the
ditch.Billy, thinking there was only one woman, grabbed one of the cooks and
tried to pull her into the ditch.  She proved much too strong for him,
however) and while resisting tore 'at his face with her sharp finger-nails.Meanwhile, her companion acted with speed and daring.  Pulling out her
large hatpin she made .for the beggar, and plunged the pin into his right eye.The screams and howls of the wounded beggar reverberated throughout the
district and brought people dashing to the scene.  Among them was a member
of the nightly police patrol who promptly arrested the groaning Billy.""Billy in the Bowl"" was tried and sentenced for robbery with violence, but
they could never prove it was he who had strangled the servant girl.  The
Grangegorman-Stoneybatter district became once again a quiet, attractive
Dublin suburb where old ladies strolled, and carefree servant girls laughed
and giggled as they wended their way home at night.daev_______________________________

3208,"As the subject line indicates, I'm sure these are stupid questions, but
I'm having trouble getting SA working like I understand it should work,
and have about given up on trying to figure it out myself.If a user has a line like:whitelist_from *@yahoogroups.comin his .spamassassin/user_prefs file, does that line not, in effect,
tell the program to take no action at all against any mail coming in from
yahoogroups.com, or is there still checking being done against it?  And if
the latter, what does he need to place in user_prefs to cause such mail
to be ignored?  I'm testing SA here with a few users who happen to be on
yahoogroups lists, before deploying it system-wide, and although the above
line has been added to their user_prefs files, much of their list mail is
still going to the spam folder due to all the usual things you would
expect to trigger SA.Thanks in advance for any help.--

Subject: Version 1.1.11 of the DCCersion 1.1.11 of the DCC source is in
http://www.rhyolite.com/anti-spam/dcc/source/dccd.tar.Z and
http://www.dcc-servers.net/dcc/source/dccd.tar.Zhttp://www.rhyolite.com/anti-spam/dcc/dcc-tree/CHANGES and
http://www.dcc-servers.net/dcc/dcc-tree/CHANGES start with    fix dccm bugs with handling a non-responsive server.
    change misc/hackmc to modify sendmail.cf to reject unauthorized relay
	attempts with a temporary failure when they are supposed to be sent
	to the DCC but dccm is not running.  This prevents leaking relay
	relay spam.  You must use the new hackmc script to install this
	change in sendmail.cf.
    remove ""# whitelisted"" from `cdcc stats` output to give more room
	for totals.
    prevent empty dccproc log files as noted by Krzysztof Snopek.
    even fatal errors should cause dccproc to exit with 0 to avoid
	rejecting mail, as noted by Krzysztof Snopek.
    When server hostnames have common IP addresses, prefer the server
	with the non-anonymous client-ID, noted by Krzysztof Snopek.

I took a bit of time to review what is on the above URL.  If I were a news 
editor, the headline would be:""Inventor"" from country that ignores patents and copyrights, seeks patent for

found others that were just common sense, things that any geek could implement
with his script/shell-language of choice; and it's time for someone to get the
medias attention on what's going on.
 Basically this is the new wave of ""namenappers""; it used to be domainnames,
not it's all the basic general ideas they can think off/find on the web that
they're patenting.

Well if you're talking about epiphany, which is in January, then yes it is
5 months.Some people do celebrate Christmas on january 6th, or even the 13th.But I am certain that what you are thinking is the correct thought.Please don't flame me. Just trying to be humerous =)

Hash: SHA1I may be dense, but why would anyone want to utilize Habeus?  To me, it looks 
like a potential backdoor to anyone's defenses against spam.If I were a spammer, I'd simply set up a server, send out my spam with the 
Habeus headers and continue till I was reasonably certain I'd been reported.  
Then I'd simply reconfigure the server and reconnect to a different IP.  As 
long as no one can establish my connection to the web sites my spam is 
directing people to, I'm home free.Since I can set up spamassassin to I don't ""lose"" any email, what do I gain 
by making it easier for spam to get through??

> me, it looks like a potential backdoor to anyone's defenses against spam.You're not dense. I'm going to zero the habeas scores on my copy of
SpamAssassin. I think they were added to SA quite prematurely. To me it's
simple:1. People who send me legitimate email have absolutely no motivation to use
Habeas, at least until it gets lots more press, and even then only
bulk-mailing companies like Amazon or eBay are going to bother, and I
already whitelist them. Individuals won't bother.2. Spammers have lots of motivation to forge the Habeas headers, and a good
percentage of them are completely out of the legal reach of Habeas.I think it should be subjected to the same testing and scrutiny as any other
potential new rule. When I test against my corpus here's what I get:OVERALL     SPAM  NONSPAM     S/O   SCORE  NAME

      0        0        0    0.00   -1.00  HABEAS_SWEThe score of -1.0 is pretty harmless right now, but it still looks like a
useless rule so far.--

""Habeas Infringers List"", and if you use their trademark without 
their permission, you'll end up on it.  Then, when you send spam 
with the misappropriated header, users of SA (2.40 supports 
this) will tag your mail as spam, rather than let it through. 
This may be done independantly of your IP address, so be 
prepared to constantly change domain names, and move your 
servers as fast as you send spam.Also, that little haiku is a copyrighted work, so not only CAN 
Habeas sue, they MUST sue to protect their copyright. And since 
it's a trademark as well, that's a double-whammy. Habeas has 
some pretty high-powered legal people, who will gladly go to 
town on violators.The whole point here is to give them the legal leverage they 
need to put spammers out of business, and not only block mail 
from them, but allow through the things that really AREN'T spam.--B-------------------------------------------------------

not determined empirically.  I am also concerned that it was added after
the rules freeze, that such a major change was not discussed in advance,
etc.There's also no evidence that the rule will actually reduce FPs.  People
who are smart enough to use the rule are probably capable of writing
email that doesn't look like spam (I'm not counting spam mailing lists
which you need to be exempted from spam filtering).Dan

the service of spamming on behalf of someone else.  You might track down
whoever paid for the mailing, but tracking down the actual sender might be
more difficult, and even if they manage to recover damages from the buyer
they haven't stopped the spammer, so the benefit is strictly to Habeas,
not to the recipients of the spam.  That's the main problem I have with
the whole scenario: My pain, Habeas's gain, and those most likely to be
held liable are those least likely to be the really serious abusers.-------------------------------------------------------

A lot of spam which *appears* to originate from China, and even 
a lot which advertises websites hosted there, is sent by, and is 
done for the benefit of, companies based in the US.  The spam 
often appears to originate there because it's coming from open 
http, or squid proxy servers.  It's hosted there because these 
spammers are now persona-non-grata on all US ISPs.  One hardly 
needs to involve the Chinese government in a case where a US 
citizen is violating US law.

current whereabouts of long-time spammers like Alan Ralksy of 
Detroit, Michigan.  Ralsky is a guy who even gives interviews to 
the news media.  If you can connect a specific corpus of spam to 
him, his street address is well known. Ralsky is a prime 
candidate for lawsuits in any state with an anti-spam law. 
Thomas Cowles is another long-time spammer, but last I heard 
he'd been jailed for stealing computer equipment from his 
business partner, Eddy Marin (also a long time spammer (You've

pump-and-dump spammer, Rodona Garst.  Seems she had an open 
file-share on her laptop, and when she forged the wrong domain, 
the real owner hacked in and posted all her private information 
on a website. Oh, look, it's still there, including the nude 
photos:http://belps.freewebsites.com/I recall this well, because the SEC was VERY interested in 
confirming the validity of the information found online.  There 
were some ""interesting"" conversations. This summer, the SEC 
released the following:http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/33-8113.htmYes, the investigation took two years, but the financial penalty 
for operating a pump-and-dump scam isn't small.  The wheels of 
government grind slow, but the grind very fine indeed.--B-------------------------------------------------------

look like third-party spam (like stock scams).  Of course, this would still 
mean that ""The U.N. is going to invade America!"" spams with SWE would get 
through.  Probably also need to ignore SWE in messages that look like 
Nigerian scams.--

3273,"Guys, the Habeas Infringers List (HIL) exists explicitly to deal with
spammers while we're getting judgments against them and especially in
other countries, where those judgments are harder to get.Please note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after
regular spammers.  Yes, some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant
pyramid schemes, and ISPs have won some theft of service suits, but the
vast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles.  So, I
can't understand how Daniel can assert that you can't track spammers
down when it's never really been tried.  We can subpoena the records of
the business they spammed on behalf of.  We can subpoena the records of
the ISP that provided them service, and of the credit card they used for
the whack-a-mole accounts.  We can use private investigators.  Yes,
these people are often lowlifes (chickenboners).  But, they're not
secret agents.  They're just trying to make a buck, and Habeas' whole
business is about finding them and putting them out of businessHabeas has the incentive to pursue spammers (that use our warrant mark)
in a way that no one ever has had before.  Given that our whole business
plan relies on Habeas becoming synonymous with ""not spam"", I can't
understand why you would assume ahead of time that we will be
unsuccessful, plan for that failure, and in so doing, remove the
potential of success, which is anti-spam filters like SA acting on the
Habeas warrant mark.Daniel, it's easy enough for you to change the Habeas scores yourself on
your installation.  If Habeas fails to live up to its promise to only
license the warrant mark to non-spammers and to place all violators on
the HIL, then I have no doubt that Justin and Craig will quickly remove
us from the next release.  But, you're trying to kill Habeas before it
has a chance to show any promise.At the end of the day, SpamAssassin is like the Club, in that it
encourages thieves (spammers) to just go after the next car (those
without SA) rather than yours.  Habeas can play the role of LoJack (the
transmitter), in enabling the apprehension of thieves so that they don't
steal any more cars.  But only if we're given a chance to succeed.          - dan

not about ISP's blocking mail or not.

after the line that says:#define EX__MAX 77Add:#if !defined __osf__
extern char *optarg;
